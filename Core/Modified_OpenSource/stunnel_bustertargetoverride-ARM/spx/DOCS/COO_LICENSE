 Linking stunnel statically or dynamically with other modules is making
 a combined work based on stunnel. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of stunnel gives you
 permission to combine stunnel with free software programs or libraries that
 are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release
 of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with
 unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the
 terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code concerned.
 .
 Note that people who make modified versions of stunnel are not obligated to
 grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice
 whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release
 a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it
 possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
