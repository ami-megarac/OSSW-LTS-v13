cyrus-sasl2 (2.1.25.dfsg1-5) unstable; urgency=low

    As of version 2.1.25.dfsg1-5, configuration of SQL engine backends have
    changed from database specific configuration (e.g. 'mysql') to generic
    'sql' auxprop plugin.

    You will need to change your configuration f.e. from:

        auxprop_plugin: mysql

    to

        auxprop_plugin: sql
        sql_engine: mysql

    Also the SQL query (if used) needs to have '%u' replaced with '%u@%r'
    because now user and realm is provided separately.
