Suggests: snmpd
Description: implementation of IEEE 802.1ab (LLDP)
 LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant
 proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as Extreme's EDP (Extreme
 Discovery Protocol) and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). The goal of
 LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver
 Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.
 .
 This implementation provides LLDP sending and reception, supports
 VLAN and includes an SNMP subagent that can interface to an SNMP
 agent through AgentX protocol.
 .
 This daemon is also able to deal with CDP, SONMP, FDP and EDP
 protocol. It also handles LLDP-MED extension.
