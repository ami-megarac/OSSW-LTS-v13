Title:          AutoGen

Version:        [=version=]

Entered-date:   [=`date +%Y-%m-%d`=]

Description:    AutoGen - [=prog_title=]

                AutoGen is a tool for automatically generating
                arbitrary text files that contain repetitive text
                with varying substitutions.  This is particularly
                useful if you have several types of repetitive
                text that all need to be kept in sync with each
                other.  The goal is to try to simplify the process
                of maintaining repetitive program text.

Keywords:       macro, m4, preprocessor, source generator,
                command line option parser
