This is libsnprintfv, a portable, extensible reimplementation of the
POSIX format printing API.  libsnprintfv provides all the features
which should be present in a POSIX format printing implementation,
but which often are not, such as guaranteed return of number of
characters printed and support for %n$ format specifiers.

In addition the the POSIX features, libsnprintfv also provides some
extensions to the API, and a GNU glibc-2 compatible printf custom
format specifier, all of which you can use with impunity if you link
with libsnprintfv, rather than worrying about whether the target C
library provides the extensions.  See the info manual for details of
the API calls available, and an explanation of how to write custom
specifier handlers.

The latest version of libsnprintfv is available from the author's
homepage: http://www.oranda.demon.co.uk.

libsnprintfv is written in a very portable K&R compatible style, and
should build anywhere that provides a reasonable C compiler and runtime.
See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
libsnprintfv.

See the file NEWS for a description of user visible changes to
libsnprintfv between releases.

See the file TODO for a list of outstanding work.
