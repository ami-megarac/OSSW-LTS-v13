NAME

    strsignal -- map a signal number to a signal message string

SYNOPSIS

    char *strsignal (int signo)

DESCRIPTION

    Maps an signal number to an signal message string, the contents of
    which are implementation defined.  On systems which have the external
    variable sys_siglist, these strings will be the same as the ones used
    by psignal().

    If the supplied signal number is within the valid range of indices
    for the sys_siglist, but no message is available for the particular
    signal number, then returns the string "Signal NUM", where NUM is the
    signal number.

    If the supplied signal number is not a valid index into sys_siglist,
    returns NULL.

    The returned string is only guaranteed to be valid only until the
    next call to strsignal.

    Also, though not declared "const", it is.
