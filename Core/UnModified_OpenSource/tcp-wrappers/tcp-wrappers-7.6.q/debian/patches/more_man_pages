+.SH NAME
+try-from \- test program for the tcp_wrapper
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B try-from
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B try\-from
+command can be called via a remote shell command to find out
+if the hostname and address are properly recognized
+by the
+.B tcp_wrapper
+library, if username lookup works, and (SysV only) if the TLI
+on top of IP heuristics work. Diagnostics are reported through
+.BR syslog (3)
+and redirected to stderr.
+
+Example:
+
+rsh host /usr/sbin/try\-from
+

+.TH SAFE_FINGER 8 "21th June 1997" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+safe_finger \- finger client wrapper that protects against nasty stuff
+from finger servers
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B safe_finger [finger_options]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B safe_finger
+command protects against nasty stuff from finger servers. Use this
+program for automatic reverse finger probes from the
+.B tcp_wrapper
+.B (tcpd)
+, not the raw finger command. The
+.B safe_finger
+command makes sure that the finger client is not run with root
+privileges. It also runs the finger client with a defined PATH
+environment.
+.B safe_finger
+will also protect you from problems caused by the output of some
+finger servers. The problem: some programs may react to stuff in
+the first column. Other programs may get upset by thrash anywhere
+on a line. File systems may fill up as the finger server keeps
+sending data. Text editors may bomb out on extremely long lines.
+The finger server may take forever because it is somehow wedged.
+.B safe_finger
+takes care of all this badness.
