Description: collection of partitioning utilities
 This package contains the classic fdisk, sfdisk and cfdisk partitioning
 utilities from the util-linux suite.
 .
 The utilities included in this package allow you to partition
 your hard disk. The utilities supports both modern and legacy
 partition tables (eg. GPT, MBR, etc).
 .
 The fdisk utility is the classical text-mode utility.
 The cfdisk utilitity gives a more userfriendly curses based interface.
 The sfdisk utility is mostly for automation and scripting uses.

Description: Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUIDs, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
 large numbers of threads trying to grab UUIDs running on different CPUs.
 It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.
