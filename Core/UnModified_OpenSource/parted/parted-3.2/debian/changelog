  * New upstream release (closes: #646130, LP: #1046391; see #754582 for
    transition tracking):
    - Improve support of DASD devices on s390 (closes: #578097).
    - Remove old and unmaintainable file system creation, deletion, and
      copying code; please use other FS-specific tools instead (closes:
      #399046, #481435, #751406).  Most resizing code is also gone, although
      HFS+ and FAT resizing is still available via libparted-fs-resize.
    - Fix snap radius to avoid miscalculation of partition size when the
      start or end is 1<unit> (closes: #706023).
  * Update binary package names to libparted2 (etc.).  We can safely drop
    the "debian1" suffix now, as the previous incarnation of libparted2 was
    about 14 years ago, and the Conflicts against it were made versioned
    four years ago in 2.2-4.
  * Split off separate packages for libparted-fs-resize, which has a
    different SONAME.
  * Remove largely-unhelpful version from libparted-i18n and libparted-dev
    package names.
  * Add .symbols files and stop using the old "make check-abi" mechanism,
    which was cumbersome and appears to be unmaintained upstream.  This is
    also more robust against differing build options (closes: #744313).
  * Convert from the long-deprecated dh_movefiles to dh_install.
  * Remove lots of parameterisation from the packaging which was intended to
    make it easier to handle SONAME changes.  Enough things still have to be
    adjusted manually that it didn't really help, and it made the packaging
    harder to understand.
  * Modernise and correct use of dpkg-architecture variables to work better
    when cross-building.
  * Drop another vestige of the old parted-bf package.
  * Stop shipping static libraries.
  * Use dh_link to fix up .so links in libparted-dev rather than doing it by
    hand in debian/rules.
  * Move development libraries into multiarch directories and mark
    libparted-dev as Multi-Arch: same.
  * Drop -fgnu89-inline workaround, which is no longer needed (and was
    actually disabled by accident in 2.3-10).
  * Drop the hardcoded minimum version passed to dh_makeshlibs, since this
    is now effectively superseded by the .symbols file.
  * Update Vcs-* to current canonical URLs.
  * Convert to dh(1).
  * Make parted and parted-udeb have exact-version dependencies on
    libparted2 and libparted2-udeb respectively.
  * Add a libparted0-dev transitional package.  Most of the packages that
    build-depend on us have a versioned build-dependency on libparted0-dev
    right now, so this greatly simplifies the transition.
  * Stop disabling pc98 support on powerpc; 3.1 tightened up pc98 probing so
    that it has many fewer false positives.
  * Remove use of --disable-Werror on several architectures; as of 3.0,
    parted no longer supports this configure option and just builds without
    -Werror.

    ended in a digit.
  * Merge remove-dev_t-dep.patch from Ubuntu: parted was making
    bad assumptions about the meaning of the values of dev_t,
    causing it to fail to detect in-use partitions on all dmraid
    disks, and regular disk partitions > #16.
  * Merge skip-floppy.patch from Ubuntu: add floppies to the list
    of ignored devices since they can not be partitioned anyhow,
    and often people have no floppy though their bios thinks they do,

  * Merge gptsync.patch from Ubuntu: On Intel Mac systems, write a

  * New upstream release.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Upstream now uses libtool's versioning system, so the SONAME has changed
    from "libparted-2.1.so.0" to "libparted.so.0".  Change library package
    names to libparted0 etc. to match.  This actually returns to a SONAME
    that was used for a few months in 2000, but it seems unlikely that that
    will cause any problems and I'd rather keep in sync with upstream.

parted (1.6.23-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oh well, built -2 in a broken chroot, fixed now.
  * Notice, i wwish to remember all readers that i have put out a request for
    help for this package, and altough people replied, no long standing help
    happened. As i am going to also need to take more upstream
    responsabilities, i definitively want to recall for help on parted
    packaging, especially for arches i am not so good with (and yes, this
    includes x86 :). For the ubuntu guys, next time you make a patch, you are
    welcome to do it in the parted subversion repository on alioth, and upload
    both packages if i don't comment for a longer time like i did in June.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jul 2005 07:33:11 +0200

parted (1.6.23-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The following patches where taken from the ubuntu parted package :
    - Fix gcc4 warning in lvm2 patch (Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com>)
    - udev-devfs-rules.dpatch: Check for devfs-style /disc => /partN
      transformation unconditionally; the system might be using udev with
      devfs rules, and if not the test is harmless.
      (Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jul 2005 22:15:46 +0000

parted (1.6.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (1.6.23)
    - PedUnit: support for different units for sizes and offsets.
    - Error message/UI cleanup.
    - More CHS cleanup.
    - Check /sys before trying deprecated SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND.
    - Better Apple_Free partition support.
    - Allow resizing of extended partitions, even if some logical partitions
      are mounted
    - Various DVH changes.
    - mac RAID and LVM support.
  * New upstream release (1.6.22)
    - hfs and hfs+ shrinking support merged in upstream.
    - gcc4 fixes.
    - minor UI and documentation changes/fixes.
    - support lvm on mac partition tables.
  * Backed out again the size column addition, was a patch from Jari Aalto
    <jari.aalto@cante.net> with regard to Bug #109613, but a new patch will
    hopefully make it to 1.6.24.
  * Unbashized dpatches (Closes: #298017)
  * Fixed amiga partition tables to use RAID/LVM partition types instead of
    subverting flags for it.
  * Removed the s390 patch, which needs a full review with regard to the
    PedUnit stuff i believe. In particular with regard to the sector size
    support. Please try to get this one integrated upstream, as it is the last 
    problematic big debian-specific patch remaining.

parted (1.6.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unstable build, as we will be moving 1.6.21 into sarge after all.
  * Readded bunch of missing fixes from the sarge/sid branch :
    - Dropped libreiserfs support.
    - Now build depends on libreadline4-dev | libreadline-dev, to work around
      the bogus libreadline5 upload during the sarge freeze. (Bug: #279574)
    - Drop any udeb magic, fixing .udeb dependency generation (Bastian Blank).
      (Bug: #270133)
    - Added mention of HFS and HFS+ resize feature in manpage. (Bug: #275650)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Jan 2005 19:07:42 +0100

parted (1.6.21-0.exp.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Dropped ubd patch, since it may be superceded by another fix in 1.6.21 :
    - Sets the type to PED_DEVICE_UNKNOWN on block devices that don't fall
      into the standard categories.  This makes libparted correctly update
      the kernel's view of partition tables, etc.
  * Added comments about upstream status to all .dpatches.
  * Dropped parted-bf, we no longer build this package in the sarge/sid version.
  * Changed libparted1.6-udeb to provide libparted1.6-12. (Bug: #292781)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Jan 2005 18:47:10 +0100

parted (1.6.21-0.exp.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - renamed prep-boot PReP boot partition name to prep.
    - Fixed PED_SWAP macros missing, obsoleting amiga-64bit dpatch.
    - Fixed sun cylinder recording stuff, obsoleting sun_disklabel dpatch.
    - Removed bogus assertion, obsoleting no-clobber dpatch.
    - Only treat the device as devfs if it has /disc on the end.
    - Now use _partition_is_mounted_by_dev instead of guessing the partition
      device name.
    - Sets the type to PED_DEVICE_UNKNOWN on block devices that don't fall
      into the standard categories.  This makes libparted correctly update
      the kernel's view of partition tables, etc.  
    - Improved heuristic for finding broken dos partition tables: test if
      any feasible solution geometry exists against the end cylinder rather
      than 1024. This heuristic now has fewer false negatives and no false
      positives.

    - only attempt to check file systems if checking is implemented for
      that file system type.
    - when correcting the boot sector, use fat_boot_sector_write() to make
      sure the backup copy gets written (if applicable).

  * Added RAID & LVM flag for partitions on amiga partition tables.

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2003 16:01:19 +1000

parted (1.6.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in: Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 4.1.1), as dh_shlibdeps'
    -L flag was introduced in that version (closes: #179473)
  * debian/rules: Update config.sub and config.guess on clean

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Feb 2003 22:13:22 +1100

parted (1.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + ped_disk_destroy API documentation inconsistency fixed (closes: #168850)
    + the invalidate: busy buffer warning message issue was actually fixed
      in the 1.6.0-pre5 release (closes: #146607)
    + Mention is now made of the root disk in the info docs (closes: #157003)
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.8:
    + Support building with gcc -g by default, support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
  * Made libparted1.6-0 Suggests: parted | nparted (closes: #168177)
  * Removed . from end of libparted1.6-0 synopsis to fix lintian error
  * Build udeb packages libparted1.6-udeb and parted-udeb for
    debian-installer, built with the -Os gcc flag to optimise for size
    (parted-bf is also now built with -Os) (thanks to
    Dann Frazier <dannf@debian.org> for a udeb patch) (closes: #172020)
  * Made libparted's reiserfs support dlopen the full filename of libreiserfs,
    rather than just the libreiserfs.so symlink. This means that parted's
    reiserfs support will now work without the libreiserfs0.3-dev package
    being installed (closes: #163107)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Dec 2002 23:25:59 +1100

parted (1.6.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * GNU Parted is now built against libreiserfs (closes: #156149)

parted (1.6.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: use readlink to read link destination (closes: #157821)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Aug 2002 18:18:23 +1000

parted (1.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control:
    + Fixed Priority: override disparities (default Priority was still extra
      from when these were experimental parted1.6 packages)
    + Remove details of pre-release status notice from package description
      (closes: #152655, #154818)
  * Direct people looking for info docs to the parted-doc package
    (closes: #152042)
  * Wierd ... ls -l x | awk '{ print $11 }' is no longer giving the symlink
    dest, $10 is though :-/. I'll see how this goes with $10 ...

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 19:40:44 +1000

parted (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

parted (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Source package renamed back to "parted", 1.6 is now considered
    "stable" so uploaded to sid

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Apr 2002 23:05:42 +1000

parted1.6 (1.5+1.6.0-pre10-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release
  * This upstream release supports creating/resizing reiserfs filesystems,
    if Yury Umanets' libreiserfs is installed. However, there is no Debian
    package of libreiserfs (yet - I am working on it). So if you want this
    support, you'll have to fetch progsreiserfs from
    http://reiserfs.linux.kiev.ua/ and compile/install it yourself for this
    support to be activated.

parted1.6 (1.5+1.6.0-pre5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Recompile against latest e2fsprogs to fix dependancy issues
    (see e2fsprogs #139274)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Mar 2002 18:19:58 +1100

parted1.6 (1.5+1.6.0-pre5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release
  * debian/{partprobe.8, parted.manpages, rules}: manpage added for partprobe
    (closes: #137104)
  * debian/control.in: make all parted1.6 packages Priority: extra, as
    parted1.6 and parted1.6-doc Conflict: with the optional parted and
    parted-doc packages.
  * removed "#include <asm/page.h>" from libparted/fs_linux_swap/linux_swap.c,
    which should fix build problems on ia64.

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Mar 2002 17:09:08 +1100

parted1.6 (1.5+1.6.0-pre4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: ship locales package separately. This
    means that libparted1.6-0 no longer needs to Conflict: libparted1.4,
    both packages can be installed concurrently. Actually, I just realised
    that libparted1.6-0 never actually needed to Conflict: libparted1.4,
    Replaces: libparted1.4 would have been enough ...
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added pre-release status of package to package descriptions
      (closes: #137475)
    - Made libparted1.6-0 Replaces: libparted1.4 (<< 1.4.24-2).
      libparted1.4 (>= 1.4.24-2) should be able to co-exist with libparted1.6,
      but I forgot about the (<< 1.4.24-2) case ... (closes: #137567)
  * debian/rules:
    - debian/rules: use DESTDIR rather than prefix when 'make install'ing.
      Use $(CURDIR) instead of `pwd`.
    - lots of small fixes
    - remove the locales dir from debian/tmp before checking if any files
      are left after dh_movefiles
  * debian/parted.files: Grab all of sbin rather than just sbin/parted.
    This picks up partprobe
  * debian/parted.undocumented: partprobe currently has no manpage (will be
    fixed before 1.6.0-1 goes into sid)

parted (1.4.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Upstream now uses C99's PRIx64 for printf'ing __u64's - this fixes
    compilation warnings on alpha and ia64 (closes: #115369)
  * This should fix all alpha compile warnings, so removed --disable-Werror
    configure flag when compiling on alpha (-Werror will help find bugs)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Oct 2001 11:00:29 +1000

    - configure.in: hacked to add --disable-Werror argument
    - debian/control: added Build-Depends on recent autoconf and automake
    - debian/rules:
      + run aclocal, autoconf and automake before ./configure'ing
      + run configure with --disable-Werror argument on m68k

      instead of parted-bf package for the last 2 releases - fixed this
    + Updated the file system support list in package descriptions
    + Removed Build-Depends: on autoconf, automake and libtool - these are
      only needed if autoconf/automake need to be re-run ... (not the case)
  * debian/rules:
    + pass the correct libparted library directory to dh_shlibdeps for
      correct parted package dependancies (closes: #102359)
  * debian/README.Debian: Updated the file system support list

parted (1.4.13+14pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Build-Depend: auto{conf,make}, libtool ... (closes: Bug#99015)
    Left the Build-Depends there anyway (just in case)
  * This upstream release uses libtool 1.4 anyway, so that alone would fix
    #99015 as well :-)
  * debian/rules:
    - explicitly specify --enable-shared to configure in configure target
      (bug workaround for this version, shared libs aren't built by default)
    - explicitly specify --disable-shared to configure in configure-dbg
      target, this should substantially shorten the build time.

parted (1.4.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some big updates - lots of library versioning stuff automated ...
    - debian/control and debian/shlibs.local now being generated from
      debian/control.in and debian/shlibs.local.in respectively, with
      debian/rules
    - debian/libparted2{,-dev}.* moved to debian/libparted{,-dev}.*,
      these are now copied to their appropriate places when necessary
    - LIBPKGVER variable added to debian/rules, this is the library
      package version (part of the library name). Initially set to
      1.4, which is the new version number of libparted (ie. the
      libparted package is now named libparted1.4, to keep in line
      with upstream). I'll add a letter which will be bumped whenever
      upstream's soname changes, if necessary (ie. libparted1.4a) ...
  * Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt (compiles without -O2).
  * debian/control.in debian/rules: Added building of libparted2-dbg
    package, unstripped static lib with malloc debugging enabled.
  * Fixed problem with ./configure being run twice, once on
    'debian/rules build' and again on 'debian/rules binary-arch'
  * Fixed shlibs library version _properly_, I changed the depends:
    version but not the soname version :-(. With the versioning automation
    stuff I have also added a LIBSONAME substitution, and also check that
    parted's soname is what debian/rules (and thus debian/shlibs.local)
    think that it is ...

  * debian/control: Updated build-depends: on debhelper to version

  * Changed shlibs to depend on 'libparted1 (>= 1.4.0)' rather than
    'libparted1 (= ${Source-Version})'.
  * Made libparted1 Conflicts: libparted0 Replaces: libparted0 (since both

parted (1.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed build system to use DH_COMPAT=2, so the 'parted' package now
    builds in the debian/parted directory. This included moving the 'dirs'
    file to 'parted.dirs', and 'docs' to 'parted.docs', amongst other things.

  * Moved parted.m4 (in /usr/share/aclocal) from parted to libparted0-dev.
  * Moved all locales (from /usr/share/locales) from parted to libparted0.
    This is the right behavior since most of the messages are for libparted,
    I have asked the author if it is possible to split parted and libparted
    locales ...
  * Made libparted0 and libparted0-dev Conflict: parted (<< 1.2.11) to
    avoid dpkg needing --force-overwrite ...
  * Added -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS in libparted/Makefile.am - to conform
    to policy 3.2.1.
  * Policy 3.2.1

parted (1.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Shared libs in libparted0 now install to /lib (otherwise it's pointless
    having the parted executable in /sbin ...)

    rather than >= ... This is because the libparted API is still changing
    quite regularly.
