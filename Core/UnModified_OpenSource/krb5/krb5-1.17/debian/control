Description: basic programs to authenticate using MIT Kerberos
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the basic programs to authenticate to MIT Kerberos,
 change passwords, and talk to the admin server (to create and delete
 principals, list principals, etc.).

 authentication credentials for a Kerberos realm, holds the master keys
 for the realm, and responds to authentication requests.  This package
 should be installed on both master and slave KDCs.

 This package contains the Kerberos slave KDC update server (kpropd). The
 kpropd command runs on the slave KDC server. It listens for update requests
 made by the kprop program, and periodically requests incremental updates from
 the master KDC. This package should be installed on slave KDCs.
