krb5 (1.13~alpha1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low
    The default location of the socket used by the OTP plugin has moved
    from /etc/krb5kdc to /run/krb5kdc/.  If the "zero-conf" krb5-otp
    functionality is in use, the software providing the other end of
    the socket must be adjusted to use the new path.
