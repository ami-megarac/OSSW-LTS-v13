.TH AUDISP-PRELUDE.CONF: "5" "Mar 2008" "Red Hat" "System Administration Utilities"
.SH NAME
audisp-prelude.conf \- the audisp-prelude configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaudisp-prelude.conf\fP is the file that controls the configuration of the audit based intrusion detection system. There are 2 general kinds of configuration option types, enablers and actions. The enablers simply have
.IR yes "/" no "
as the only valid choices.

The action options currently allow
.IR ignore ", and "idmef "
as its choices. The 
.IR ignore
option means that the IDS still detects events, but only logs the detection in response. The
.IR idmef
option means that the IDS will send an IDMEF alert to the prelude manager upon detection.

The configuration options that are available are as follows:

.TP
