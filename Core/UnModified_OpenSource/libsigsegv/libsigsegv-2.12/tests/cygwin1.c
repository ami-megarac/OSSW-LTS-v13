/* Cygwin uses faults for internal purposes, i.e. even when the user passes
   valid pointers to all system calls.

   An example is pthread_attr_init.  POSIX:2001 states pthread_attr_init may
   fail with EBUSY if an object was previously initialized. Â Recognizing
   whether an object was previously initialized can be done with a magic
   cookie.  If the type pthread_attr_t is defined as
     struct { int magic; ... other_data; }
   it is easy.  But in Cygwin, pthread_attr_t is defined as a pointer type.
   Cygwin implements the check by testing whether the pthread_attr_t contains
   a pointer to a memory region that contains a particular magic cookie.
   This indirection may fault.  (Search for pthread_attr_init and
   verifyable_object_isvalid in the Cygwin sources.)  In this example we trick
   Cygwin into dereferencing the address 0x01010101.  */
