iptables (1.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    All the iptables binaries have been moved away from /sbin to /usr/sbin.
    Some compatibility symlinks have been added for the Buster release cycle,
    but please make sure your scripts aren't using hardcoded binary paths.
    The plan after Buster is to drop the symlinks.

iptables (1.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    By default, this package will try to use the nf_tables kernel backend
    instead of the xtables one. Please, read more about this in
    /usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian, including details about the new
    update-alternatives configuration possibilities.
    This is a major update on the way iptables works and may have severe impact
    in running systems which are upgrading between Debian versions.
    The arptables and ebtables binaries are also affected, and those packages
    will be updated soon as well.
