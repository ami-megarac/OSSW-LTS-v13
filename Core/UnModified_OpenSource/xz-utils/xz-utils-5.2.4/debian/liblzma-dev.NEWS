xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100527-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version, the declarations needed to use the Subblock
  filter are not present in the liblzma headers.  liblzma never supported
  the Subblock filter, so compiled applications should not be affected by
  this change.

  The lzma_restrict macro has been removed from the liblzma headers.  This
  only affects the declarations contained there; the semantics are still the
  same.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100212-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Starting with this version, the lzma_block_header_decode() function
  is advertised to require its block->version parameter to be initialized.
  Future versions of liblzma may use an alternate version of the Block
  options if the application declares it supports it.  Existing applications
  will continue to work for now because the only supported Block format
  version is zero.
