"There are services installed on your system which need to be restarted when "

"these restarts may cause interruptions of service for the system, you will "
"normally be prompted on each upgrade for the list of services you wish to "
"restart.  You can choose this option to avoid being prompted; instead, all "
"necessary restarts will be done for you automatically so you can avoid being "
"asked questions on each library upgrade."
