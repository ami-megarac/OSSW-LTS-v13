      /proc/1/limits is upstream, this patch now only handles the policy
      of resetting limits by default and not applying glob limits to root.
    - debian/patches/fix-manpage-crud: drop, manpages now being generated
      upstream with a newer, fixed xsltproc.
    - debian/patches/pam_env-fix-overflow.patch, pam_env-fix-dos.patch,
      glibc-2_16-compilation-fix.patch, sys-types-include.patch: drop,

  * Add build-dependency on pkg-config.
  * Ensure autogenerated files are after source files in all relevant patches,

  * Drop the --disable-regenerate-docu argument, restoring the HTML manuals
    to the libpam-doc package.  Closes: #700485.
  * No need to override dh_compress in debian/rules, it already handles .html
    files correctly.

    Schepler <dschepler@gmail.com>.  Closes: #693450.
  * Ditch autoconf patch in favor of a build-dependency on dh-autoreconf,
    which will let us keep up-to-date with newer autotools.  In the present
    instance, this gets us aarch64 support.
  * Install pam_timestamp_check - and while we're at it, move the manpage
    to the correct binary package.  Closes: #648695.
  * Update lintian overrides to suppress some noise about hardening and
    manpages.
  * Enable audit support, by popular demand.  This should have no major
    impact unless you're also running auditd; but I reserve the right to
    disable this again in the event that this causes a performance hit or
    breaks upgrades (since the dependency is pulled into libpam, not just

  * Use debian/clean instead of rm -f'ing files in debian/rules clean target
  * Drop ./configure options that are no-ops
  * Drop the /lib/security/pam_unix_*.so symlinks, which have been deprecated
    now for 10 years and are not used at all if pam-auth-update is in play.
  * Drop the pam_rhosts_auth.so symlink as well, and document in NEWS.Debian
    that this is now obsolete.
  * Drop stale content from README.debian: some of this should have been in
    NEWS.Debian instead (but is so old it's not worth putting it there now),
    some of it is obsolete by the change in package VCS.
  * Convert debian/rules to debhelper 7 and add versioned build-dependencies
    on debhelper and quilt to suit.
  * Drop CFLAGS that we don't need anymore (-fPIC, -D_REENTRANT,
    -D_GNU_SOURCE).
  * Explicitly add -O0 to CFLAGS when noopt is set.
  * debian/patches/autoconf.patch: pull ltmain.sh in, to fix some spurious
    library linkage in the modules.
  * Move pam_cracklib manpage to the libpam-cracklib package, and add the

pam (1.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for RC bugfix.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * pam_unix-chkpwd-wait: don't assume that the unix_chkpwd process exits
    normally; if it was killed by a signal, we don't want to accept the
    password.  Closes: #495879.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * 007_modules_pam_unix: update the manpage at the same time as the xml
    source (grr, autogenerated files in source packages).  Closes: #495804.
  * 055_pam_unix_nullok_secure: also don't call the helper at all from
    _unix_blankpasswd when we can detect that null passwords are disallowed,
    to avoid causing spammy logs on successful authentications.
    Closes: #496620.
  * debian/rules: call chgrp *before* calling chmod, lest the sgid bit
    on unix_chkpwd be cleared during the build when using -rsudo.
    Closes: #496983.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Aug 2008 22:59:23 -0700

pam (1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * 055_pam_unix_nullok_secure: don't call _pammodutil_tty_secure with a NULL
    tty argument, since this will cause our helper to segfault instead of
    returning a useful value.  Thanks to Troy Davis for the report.
    Closes: #495806.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Aug 2008 11:55:47 -0700

pam (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * 007_modules_pam_unix: update the documentation to correctly document
    the default minimum password length is 6, not 1.
  * Look for cups instead of cupsys as an init script name when restarting
    services; thanks to Stephen Olander-Waters for pointing this out.
    Closes: #492977.
  * Update the Debian PAM mini-policy to remove references to the
    long-obsolete pam_pwdb, and clarify the relationship between pam_stack
    and @include.
  * Drop various bits of unused cruft from the debian/ directory.
  * Drop libpam-runtime.preinst, only used for upgrades from woody to sarge
    to deal with modified conffiles.
  * Build-Conflict with libdb4.2-dev, which satisfies the libdb-dev
    build-dependency but causes pam_userdb to be silently omitted.
    Closes: #493574.
  * 054_pam_security_abstract_securetty_handling: move the warning log about
    an insecure tty back to pam_securetty proper; we don't want to generate
    log messages every time pam_unix is called as non-root.
    Closes: #493283.  As a side-effect, pam_unix no longer logs any warnings
    about NULL password + insecure tty, but I don't think this is critical.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 08 Aug 2008 10:47:26 -0700

pam (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - pam_limits: bound RLIMIT_NICE from below. Closes: #403718.
    - pam_mail: set the MAIL variable even when .hushlogin is set.
      Closes: #421010.
    - new minclass option introduced for pam_cracklib.  Closes: #454237.
    - fix a failure to check the string length when matching usernames in
      pam_group.  Closes: #444427.
    - fix setting shell security context in pam_selinux.  Closes: #451722.
    - use --disable-audit, to avoid libaudit being linked in
      accidentally
    - pam_unix now supports SHA-256 and SHA-512 password hashes.
      Closes: #484249, LP: #245786.
    - pam_rhosts_auth is dropped upstream (closes: #382987); add a compat
      symlink to pam_rhosts to support upgrades for a release, and give a
      warning in NEWS.Debian.
    - new symbol in libpam.so.0, pam_modutil_audit_write; shlibs bump, and
      do another round of service restarts on upgrade.
    - pam_unix helper is now called whenever an unprivileged process
      tries and fails to query a user's account status.  Closes: #367834.
  * Drop patches 006_docs_cleanup, 015_hurd_portability,
    019_pam_listfile_quiet, 024_debian_cracklib_dict_path, 038_support_hurd,
    043_pam_unix_unknown_user_not_alert, 046_pam_group_example,
    no_pthread_mutexes, limits_wrong_strncpy, misc_conv_allow_sigint.patch,
    pam_tally_audit.patch, 057_pam_unix_passwd_OOM_check, and
    065_pam_unix_cracklib_disable which have been merged upstream.
  * Patch 022_pam_unix_group_time_miscfixes: partially merged upstream;
    now is really just "pam_group_miscfixes".
  * Patch 007_modules_pam_unix partially superseded upstream; stripping
    hpux-style expiry information off of password fields is now supported.
  * New patch pam_unix_thread-safe_save_old_password.patch, to make sure all
    our getpwnam() use in pam_unix is thread-safe (fixes an upstream
    regression)
  * New patch pam_unix_fix_sgid_shadow_auth.patch, fixing an upstream
    regression which prevents sgid shadow apps from being able to authenticate
    any more because the module forces use of the helper and the helper won't
    allow authentication of arbitrary users.  This change does mean we're
    going to be noisier for the time being in an SELinux environment, which
    should be addressed but is not a regression on Debian.
  * New patch pam_unix_dont_trust_chkpwd_caller.patch, rolling back an
    upstream change that causes unix_chkpwd to assume that setuid(getuid())
    is sufficient to drop permissions and attempt any authentication on
    behalf of the user.
  * The password-changing helper functionality for SELinux systems has been
    split out into a separate unix_update binary, so at long last we can
    change unix_chkpwd to be sgid shadow instead of suid root.
    Closes: #155583.
    - Update the lintian override to match.
  * Install the new unix_update helper into libpam-modules.
  * Use a pristine upstream tarball instead of repacking; requires various
    changes to debian/rules and debhelper files.
  * Replace the Vcs-Svn field with a Vcs-Bzr field; jumping ship from svn,
    and how!
  * Debconf translations:
    - Romanian, thanks to Igor Stirbu <igor.stirbu@gmail.com>
      (closes: #491821)
  * Add libpam0g.symbols, for finer-grained package dependencies with
    dpkg-gensymbols.
  * Fix debian/copyright to list the known copyright holders
  * Fix up the doc-base sections for the libpam-doc documentation, "Apps"
    should not be part of the section name
  * Also fix up whitespace issues in the doc-base abstracts
  * Fix a typo in the libpam0g-dev description.
  * 027_pam_limits_better_init_allow_explicit_root: RLIM_INFINITY is also
    invalid for RLIMIT_NOFILE, so when resetting the limits for a new session,
    use the kernel default of 1024 instead.  Closes: #404836.
  * Create /etc/environment on initial install of libpam-modules (or on
    upgrade from an old version), to quell warnings in the logs about it
    being missing.  Closes: #442049.
  * 026_pam_unix_passwd_unknown_user: drop a redundant, and broken, check for
    the NSS source of our user; this was preventing password changes for NIS
    users, which otherwise should have worked.  Closes: #203222, LP: #9224.
  * New patch do_not_check_nis_accidentally: respect the 'nis' option
    (set or unset) when looking up the user's password entry for password
    changes.  Thanks to Quentin Godfroy <godfroy@clipper.ens.fr> for the
    patch.  Closes: #469635.
  * Drop patch 049_pam_unix_sane_locking, which upon review is not needed;
    it reduces the length of time we hold the lock, but at the expense of
    being able to enforce minimum times between password changes.
  * debian/watch: upstream has hit 1.0, so we're no longer in a "pre"
    directory.  Fix up the regex for uscan.
  * Fix the libpam0g-dev examples directory to not include a gratuitous
    .cvsignore file.
  * New patch, pam.d-manpage-section, to fix the manpage references to
    point to section 5 instead of section 8.
  * Update patch PAM-manpage-section to fix the references to pam(7) from
    other manpages.  Closes: #470137.
  * Add debian/README.source documenting that this package uses quilt.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
  * Fix a bug in the uid-restoring code in the hurd_no_setfsuid patch; thanks
    to Tomas Mraz <tmraz@redhat.com> for indirectly bringing this to my
    attention

    recognized fields.
  * Add a Homepage field.  Closes: #473338.
  * Drop -DCRACKLIB_DICTS from CFLAGS, since the referenced define is no
    longer provided by cracklib2-dev 2.8 and above.  This requires a
    build-dependency on the corresponding version of libcrack2-dev.
    Closes: #490236.

    for pass_min_len, don't gratuitously move the length checking into the
    "obscure" checks, and internationalize the error strings.
  * Stop overriding the built-in default minimum password length in
    /etc/pam.d/common-password, and also drop the "max" option which has now
    been obsoleted.
  * Fix up the comments in /etc/pam.d/common-password to make it clear that
    the options are specific to pam_unix.  Closes: #414559.
  * Patch 038: fix another thinko in the getline handling.  Closes: #442276.
  * If there are active X logins, don't restart kdm, wdm, and xdm by default;
    instead, display a debconf error if they haven't been restarted.
    Closes: #441843.
  * Drop the local patch for Linux capabilities in pam_limits; Linux
    capabilities are not generally useful in a PAM context, and the PAM
    capabilities patch has been broken through much of its life.
    Closes: #440130.
  * -Wl,-z,defs was never enabled correctly, drop it since upstream is

pam (0.99.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * libpam0g.postinst, libpam0g.templates: gdm doesn't need to be restarted
    to fix the library skew, only reloaded; special-case this daemon in the
    postinst and remove the mention of it from the debconf template, also
    tightening the language of the debconf template in the process.
    Closes: #440074.
  * Add courier-authdaemon to the list of services that need to be
    restarted; thanks to Micah Anderson for reporting.
  * New patch pam_env_ignore_garbage.patch: fix pam_env to really skip over
    garbage lines in /etc/environment and log an error, instead of failing
    with an obscure error; and ignore any PAM_BAD_ITEM values returned
    by pam_putenv(), since this is the expected error return when trying
    to delete a non-existent var.  Closes: #439984.
  * Yet another thinko in hurd_no_setfsuid and in
    029_pam_limits_capabilities; this code should really be Hurd-safe at
    last...
  * getline() returns -1 on EOF, not 0; check this appropriately, to fix
    an infinite loop in pam_rhosts_auth.  Thanks to Stephan Springl
    <springl-rhosts@bfw-online.de> for the fix.  Closes: #440019.
  * Use ${misc:Depends} for libpam0g, so we get a proper dependency on
    debconf.
  * 019_pam_listfile_quiet: per discussion with upstream, don't suppress
    errors about missing files or files with wrong permissions; these are
    real errors that should not be buried.
  * Drop the remainder of 061_pam_issue_double_free, not required for the
    original bugfix.
  * Drop patch 064_pam_unix_cracklib_dictpath, which is not needed now that
    we define CRACKLIB_DICTS in debian/rules.
  * Drop patch 063_paswd_segv, superseded by a different upstream fix
  * Split 047_pam_limits_chroot_string_value up between
    008_modules_pam_limits_chroot and 029_pam_limits_capabilites
  * Updates to patch 007_modules_pam_unix: restore the same built-in min
    password len of 6 that upstream uses; fix a typo panlindrome ->
    palindrome.
  * The 'max=' option was never intended to be used to limit maximum password
    length for users, only to declare what the number of significant
    characters /is/ for a password.  But we don't need a config option to
    tell us that, we know the answer based on which crypt type we're using,
    so drop this as a config file option.  Closes: #389197.

    for reporting.  Closes: #331278.
  * New patch misc_conv_allow_sigint.patch: allow SIGINT to be handled by the
    application, instead of blocking it when misc_conv is in use and
    preventing users from being able to ^C at any PAM prompt.  Closes: #1708.
  * 024_debian_cracklib_dict_path: default to NULL instead of a specific
    dictionary path when none is defined for consistency with the new upstream
    version of cracklib, and define our path in debian/rules.
  * 055_pam_unix_nullok_secure: document the pam_unix "nullok_secure" option,
    a prereq for forwarding this patch upstream.  Closes: #325974.
  * Create /etc/security/opasswd on new installs or on upgrades from

  * Fix a memory leak in the pam_limits capabilities patch: always
    cap_free() the cap_t before returning from pam_sm_open_session().

  * libpam0g.postinst, libpam0g.templates: on upgrades from versions

pam (0.99.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; thanks to Roger Leigh and Jan Christoph Nordholz
    for their extensive work in helping to prepare for this update in Debian.
    Closes: #360460.
    - now uses autoconf for library detection, so SELinux should not be
      unconditionally enabled on non-Linux archs.  Closes: #333141.
    - pam_mail notice handling has been completely reworked, so there should
      no longer be missing spaces in the messages.  Closes: #119689.
    - with libtool and autoconf, now behaves "sensibly" on unknown
      platforms.  Closes: #165067.
    - the source now builds without warnings.  Closes: #212165.
    - uses automake instead of hand-rolled makefiles with indentation
      bugs.  Closes: #241661, #328084.
    - pam_mkhomedir now creates directories recursively as needed.
      Closes: #178225.
    - pam_listfile now supports being used as a session module too.
      Closes: #416665.
    - misspelled pam_userdb log message has been corrected.  Closes: #305058.
    - the current pam_strerror manpage no longer mentions "Unknown
      Linux-PAM error".  Closes: #220157.
    - the text documentation no longer uses ANSI bold sequences.
      Closes: #181451.
    - pam_localuser now supports being used as a session module.
      Closes: #412484.
    - package no longer fails to build with dash as /bin/sh.
      Closes: #331208.
    - All modules should now be documented in the system administrator
      guide.  Closes: #350620.
    - pam_userdb now logs an error instead of segfaulting when no db=
      option is provided.  Closes: #436005.
    - pam_time now warns on a missing tty instead of erroring out,
      making it possible to use the module with non-console services.
      Closes: #127931.
    - upstream changelog is now 'ChangeLog' instead of 'CHANGELOG'; install
      accordingly
    - bump the shlibs
    - the 'test.c' example no longer exists
    - add /usr/share/locale to libpam-runtime.
    - CVE-2005-2977: only uid=0 is allowed to invoke unix_chkpwd with an
      arbitrary username, and then only when SELinux is active.
      Closes: #336344.
  * Mark myself as primary maintainer as previously discussed with Sam, and
    add Roger as an uploader.
  * Refactor to use quilt.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.7.2.
  * Drop unnecessary build-dependency on patch, which is
    build-essential (and no longer invoked directly).
  * Drop patches 002_debian_no_ldconfig_call, 010_pam_cplusplus,
    018_man_fixes, 030_makefile_link_against_libpam,
    037_pam_issue_ttyname_can_be_null, 044_configure_supports_bsd,
    050_configure_in_gnu and 052_pam_unix_no_openlog, which have been
    superseded upstream.
  * Drop patches 005_pam_limits_099_6,
    012_pam_group_less_restrictive_charset, 023_pam_env_limits_miscfixes,
    048_pam_group_colon_valid_char, 058_pam_env_enable, 059_pam_userdb_segv,
    060_pam_tally_segv and 062_c++_safe_headers, which have been integrated

  * Patches 006, 008, 036: update for the switch from SGML to XML.
  * Patch 007: update for the switch from SGML to XML; drop some log
    messages that were already added upstream; update for the pam_modutil
    changes; tighten the flag handling of the 'obscure' option; drop bogus
    check in unix_chkpwd for null passwords.  Also fix a grammar error
    along the way.  Closes: #362855.
  * Patch 024: CRACKLIB_DICTPATH is no longer set in configure.in, so patch
    pam_cracklib.c instead to use the default dictpath already available
    from crack.h; and patch configure.in to use AC_CHECK_HEADERS instead
    of AC_CHECK_HEADER, so crack.h is actually included.  Also remove
    unnecessary string copies, which break on the Hurd due to PATH_MAX.
  * Patch 038: partially merged/superseded upstream; also add new Hurd
    fix for pam_xauth.
  * Patch 061: partially merged upstream
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version} in
    debian/control.
  * Remove empty maintainer scripts debian/libpam0g-dev.{postinst,prerm},
    debian/libpam0g.{postinst,prerm}, and
    debian/libpam-modules.{postinst,prerm}; debhelper can autogenerate these
    just fine without our help.
  * Build-Depend on xsltproc, libxml2-utils, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl
    and w3m instead of on linuxdoc-tools, linuxdoc-tools-latex, tetex-extra,
    groff, and opensp.
  * Also build-depend on flex for libfl.a.
  * Updates for documentation handling:
    - move debian/local/pam-*-guide to debian/libpam-doc.doc-base.foo-guide,
      and invoke dh_installdocs instead of installing these by hand.
    - drop libpam-doc.{postinst,prerm}, which are no longer needed.
    - add an install target to debian/rules, and have binary-indep depend on
      it instead of trying to install doc files individually from the source
      tree
    - consequently, drop libpam-doc.dirs as well which is no longer needed
      and no longer accurate
    - add debian/libpam-doc.install for moving the docs to the right place,
      and also replace libpam-runtime.files with libpam-runtime.install;
      for the moment this means we're using both dh_movefiles and
      dh_install...
    - libpam0g.docs: install the Debian-PAM-MiniPolicy from here, further
      cleaning up debian/rules
  * Drop debian/libpam0g.links, no longer needed because upstream now has a
    working install target which creates the library symlinks
  * Add libpam-modules.links: create pam_unix_{acct,auth,passwd,session}.so
    symlinks by hand, no longer provided upstream.
  * debian/patches-applied/PAM-manpage-section: "PAM" is not a daemon, manpage
    belongs in section 7, not in section 8.
  * Actually ship the pam, pam.conf, and pam.d manpages in libpam-runtime.
  * debian/patches-applied/autoconf.patch: move all changes to autotools
    generated files into a single patch at the end of the stack.
    - don't touch configure in debian/rules, the quilt patch takes care
      of this for us.
  * New patch 064_pam_unix_cracklib_dictpath: correctly define
    CRACKLIB_DICTS, since this is not defined by configure.  Thanks to Jan
    Christoph Nordholz.
  * New patch 065_pam_unix_cracklib_disable: Debian-specific patch to disable
    cracklib support in pam_unix.  Thanks to Christoph Nordholz.
  * debian/rules:
    - Rename OS_CFLAGS to CFLAGS.
    - kill off references to unused variables
    - make binary-arch also depend on the install target, and streamline the
      rules
    - fix up the clean target to not ignore errors; thanks to Roger Leigh
    - drop the local module_check target in favor of using -Wl,-z,defs
      in LDFLAGS to enforce correct linkage of all objects at build time
  * Drop debian/local/unix_chkpwd.8 in favor of the upstream manpage.
  * libpam-modules.files: /usr/sbin/pam_tally has moved to /sbin/pam_tally
    for consistency.
  * Update to debhelper V5.
  * Don't ship Makefiles as part of the libpam0g-dev examples.
  * libpam-modules.manpages, libpam-runtime.manpages, libpam0g-dev.manpages:
    put all the manpages in the correct packages.  Closes: #411812,
    #62193, #313486, #300773, #330545, #184270.
  * Drop libpam{0g,0g-dev,-modules,-runtime}.dirs, not needed for anything
    because we aren't trying to ship empty directories in the packages
  * Build-Conflict with fop, to avoid unreproducible builds of pdf
    documentation from a tool in contrib.
  * libpam-cracklib should depend on a real wordlist package, per policy;
    use wamerican as the default.
  * Drop local/pam-undocumented.7 from the package, since we no longer have
    a reason to ship it
  * Add lintian overrides for known false-positives
  * Conflicts/Replaces/Provides libpam-umask, now included upstream.
    Closes: #436222.
  * Upstream no longer marks unix_chkpwd suid-root for us, so set the perms
    by hand in debian/rules.  In the process, unix_chkpwd is now writable
    by the owner, as expected by policy.  Closes: #368100.
  * Migrate from db4.3 to db4.6; once again, no administrator action should
    be needed for upgrading on-disk database formats.  Closes: #354309.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control; thanks to
    Laurent Bigonville for the hint.  Closes: #439038.
  * Add a watch file for use with uscan; thanks to Laurent Bigonville for
    this patch as well.  Closes: #439040.
  * Rewrite of 031_pam_include, fixing a memory leak and letting us drop
    patch 056_no_label_at_end; thanks to Jan Christoph Nordholz
    <hesso@pool.math.tu-berlin.de> for this much-improved version!
  * New patch no_pthread_mutexes: don't use pthread mutexes in
    pam_modutil functions, they're not needed because pam handles
    themselves should not be used concurrently by multiple threads and
    using pthreads causes problems for portable linking.
  * New patch hurd_no_setfsuid: if we don't have sys/fsuid.h, work around
    using setreuid instead.

pam (0.79-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Medium-urgency upload; at least one RC bugfix, but also a
    significant number of changes, hence not urgency=high.
  * Move libpam-modules and libpam0g to Section: libs and libpam-runtime
    to section: admin, to match the overrides in the archive.
  * Move old changelog entries (well, entry) that don't follow the current
    format to debian/changelog.old, since there's no way to figure out a
    timestamp for an 8-year-old upload, and this is the most effective
    way to clear a glut of lintian warnings.
  * Fix the formatting of the libpam-cracklib package description.
  * Patch 010: remove parts of the patch that aren't necessary for C++
    compatibility.
  * Patch 060: fix a segfault in pam_tally caused by misuse of
    pam_get_data(); already fixed upstream.  Closes: #335273.
  * Patch 061: fix a double free in pam_issue, caused by overuse (and misuse)
    of strdup (similar to patch 059).  Already fixed upstream.
    Closes: #327272.
  * Don't build-depend on libselinux1-dev and libcap-dev on kfreebsd archs.
    Closes: #352329.
  * Patch 005: sync pam_limits with upstream:
    - support "-" (unlimited) for all limit types except process priority.
    - support the additional aliases "-1", "unlimited", and "infinity" for
      clearing the limits; closes: #122400, #149027.
    - restrict the range of process priority, login count, and system login
      count settings to (INT_MIN,INT_MAX) (heh).
    - special-case RLIM_INFINITY when applying multipliers to values from
      the config.
    - document maxsyslogins in the default limits.conf; closes: #149883.
    - use the current process priority as a default instead of resetting to
      0; closes: #241663.
    - add support for (and document) new RLIMIT_NICE and RLIMIT_RTPRIO
      settings in Linux 2.6.12 and above; closes: #313542, #313588.
    - allow imposing limits on uid=0.
  * Patch 027: only set RLIM_INFINITY as the default for the limits where
    we know this is sensible, so that recompiling in an environment with new
    limits doesn't create a security hole -- as happened with RLIMIT_NICE and
    RLIMIT_RTPRIO!  Thanks to Ville Hallik for the initial patch.
    Closes: #388431.
  * Patch 029, 047: Fix up the broken pam_limits capabilities patch so it
    actually works -- which may well be a first...  Closes: #318452.

  * Patch 059
    - Fix a segfault in pam_userdb when the new "crypt=" option
      is unset, as will be the case for all existing users; already fixed
      upstream.  Closes: #330829.
    - Fix a memory leak in the same code due to gratuitous strdup()s.
  * Further regression in pam_env: don't treat a missing /etc/environment
    as a fatal error, either.  Amend patch 058 accordingly.  Closes: #330852.

pam (0.79-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The ".c.o: rm -rf $@" release
  * Fix debian/rules so that make clean doesn't remove ./configure when the
    timestamp on configure.in is newer (!).
  * Switch pam_userdb from db3 to db4.3, which according to the libdb
    maintainers should require no manual intervention for upgrading on-disk
    database formats.  Closes: #165068.
  * Patch 058:  yes, of course we want to read /etc/environment by
    default.  Grr!  Revert upstream change which disables this for no
    apparent reason (closes: #330458).
  * Tweak selinux rootok code to use the version of the function call that
    doesn't pollute namespace

    - fixes segfaults in libpam on config file syntax errors
      (closes: #330097).
  * Drop patches 000_bootstrap, 004_libpam_makefile_static_works,

    integrated upstream.
  * Merge one last bit of patch 053 into patch 043, where it should have
    been in the first place
  * Patch 057: SELinux support:
    - add support to pam_unix for copying SELinux security contexts when
      writing out new passwd/shadow files and creating lockfiles
    - support calling unix_chkpwd if opening /etc/shadow fails due to
      SELinux permissions
    - allow unix_chkpwd to authenticate for any user when in an SELinux
      context (hurray!); we depend on SELinux policies to prevent the
      helper's use as a brute force tool
    - also support querying user expiration info via unix_chkpwd
    - misc cleanup: clean up file descriptors when invoking unix_chkpwd
      (closes: #248310)
    - make pam_rootok check the SELinux passwd class permissions, not just
      the uid
    - add new pam_selinux module (closes: #249499)
  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev.
  * Fix pam_getenv, so that it can read the actual format of /etc/environment
    instead of trying to read it using the syntax of
    /etc/security/pam_env.conf; thanks to Colin Watson for the patch.
    Closes: #327876.
  * Set LC_COLLATE=C when using alphabetic range expressions in
    debian/rules; bah, so *that's* what kept happening to my README file
    when trying to build out of svn!  Closes: #295296.

  * Merge build-depends and build-depends-indep because I'm a bad person
    and was too lazy to make docs build in a separate pass.  I'll deal in
    a few versions.

    getgrent() returns only the members of the group listed in /etc/group.
    This is ok, because if it's really that important, you can actually

    zero length, closes: #45686, #45632
  * pam_unix_acct.c: allow '0' to denote disabled for some expiry fields
    since chage(1) documents it this way, closes: #45446
  * pam_mail.c|modules/pam_mail.sgml: added 2 options, one "standard" to
    give the old style "You have ..." response and "quiet" which only
    reports new mail for both formats, documented both options,
    closes: #45670
  * with the new pam_unix module, this bug is fixed, closes: #42230
  * pam_limits.c: make sure that we not only ignore limits on root, we
    also remove them just in case we are su'ing from a limited user to
    the root account (since as root they can remove the limits anyway),
    closes: #35302

pam (0.69-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: fixed module_check
  * pam_env/pam_env.c: fixed env parsing to include values wrapped in ''
    and also allow continued lines with a trailing '\'.
  * pam_motd,pam_mail: converted to session modules, so that they could
    be ordered with the lastlog module
  * updated default pam.d/login to reflect above change (now login looks
    the same as the non-PAM version, lastlog, then motd, and then mail
    check)
  * pam_motd: removed extraneous \n from output
  * modules/pam_limits/pam_limits.c: Fixed parsing of lines with only
    "domain -", which was documented as being able to get rid of limits
    for that user or group.
  * debian/control: (libpam-cracklib) Added depends for cracklib-runtime,
    closes: #45488
  * modules/pam_env.c: Fixed /etc/environment parsing causing segfaults on
    long lines, closes: #45408

  * Install unix_chkpwd suid root, it's needed for NIS to work without
    modification to the binary.
  * modules/pam_limits/pam_limits.c: hmm, some how I got a strange broken
    patch left over from the source upgrade...removed all but the pwdb
    purging, closes: #45088
  * modules/pam_env/pam_env.c: Changed to a debug message, instead of a
    syslog message when /etc/environment does not exist.

pam (0.69-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed libpam0g's preinst check for full paths in the pam.d files,
    this should really be a lintian check at build (i think the old libpam
    could not work like this, but hey...things change for the better some
    times. This PAM works fine like that). closes: #45001
   +NOTE: Debian packages should not reference modules by the full path
    so they don't break if I ever decide to move the modules to a different
    default directory. Only the admin should reference full paths and only
    for locally installed modules. I have submitted a request to check for
    this in lintian along with a few other devious things.
  * debian/patches/008_pam_mkhomedir: Fix title of sgml doc
  * modules/pam_userdb/Makefile: added patch for building against glibc 2.0

pam (0.69-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/modules/pam_cracklib.sgml: changed to correct path for
    cracklib_dict reference.
  * modules/pam_env/pam_env.c: now groks bash style env's from
    /etc/environment to be compatible with other programs that use it.
  * modules/pam_securetty/pam_securetty.c: don't just plain fail when
    root isn't allowed to login, fake a password request just like any
    good auth module would. Keeps us from letting them know that they
    are doing something bad :)
  * modules/pam_{motd,mkhomedir}: merged these two modules into this
    source, also wrote corresponding sgml files for libpam-doc,
    closes: #40754
  * debian/control: Moved libpam0g, libpam-modules and libpam-runtime
    to base with required priority since login depends on them and
    policy will require this

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Sep 1999 08:06:02 -0400

pam (0.69-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified build so that it uses libs and headers in the build tree
    rather than on the local system. This involved changint the build
    order slightly and should make it easier to compile on new archs.
  * Modified pam_limits so that it was invoked during pam_sm_setcred()
    instead of during pam_sm_session_open() so that it will work with
    shadow's su.
  * Fixed missing symbols in libpam.so, they were caused by it thinking
    it was supposed to have static modules built in.
  * Fixed problem where libpam was getting built with -DDEBUG
  * pam_unix_passwd.c: Changed the perms on shadow to be 0.42 and 0640
    instead of 0.0 and 0600
  * unix_chkpwd: fix it not being sgid shadow

    - Lot's of documentation cleanups
  * Converted build system to dbs (doogie's build system, aka Adam Heath)
  * Fixed libpam.so compilation so that it did not link with any of the
    modules (this was causing lot's of problems, closes; #43913, #40739
  * modules/pam_ftp/pam_ftp.c: Fixed sizeof, to use strlen,

  * Postscript pages are now generated correctly, closes: #41608
  * Moved to FHS compliance (including use of debhelper 2.0.40),
    this also raises the policy version to 3.0.1.1
  * Don't check the paths in /etc/pam.d files anymore. This is old
    and causes nothing but complaints, closes: #39747
  * Build libpam0g-dbg with debuggable static and shared libraries, also
    enabled the internal DEBUG_REL compile flag for these so that the
    debugging messages will also be output

  * Added ability for pam_env to parse /etc/environment and updated
    docs to reflect it
  * Applied patch for pwdb_chkpwd man page, closes: #38976
  * Merged pam_unix_*.so modules into one pam_unix.so with symlinks
    for backward compatibility. This helps centralize this module the
    same way the pam_pwdb.so is and the way pam_unix.so is on other
    operating systems (commercial ones specifically).
  * Closed by pam-apps upload, closes: #38632
  * Fixed `sgml2latex' syntax, closes: #39119

  * Made regex for libpam0g postinst a little more specific so it
    didn't flag false problems. closes: #34626
  * Applied patch to fix pam_ftp, closes: #35388
  * Modified pam_mail and pam_lastlog to honor PAM_SILENT in order to

    libpam-runtime)
  * Added a depends for libpam-runtime to libpam0g (was supposed to be
    there, must have deleted it)
  * Removed empty /usr/bin from libpam-runtime (old directory where
    upperLOWER was)

  * Added md5 flag for pam_unix_passwd.so
  * Removed upperLOWER program since it is just an example. Moved it's
    source to the examples directory in libpam-modules
  * Fixed documentation of pam_strerror() and examples. closes #31142
  * Made pam_unix_passwd.so leave /etc/shadow mode 640 and root.shadow
    after changes
  * Fixed problem in pam_unix_auth that didn't let you su from a normal
    user to another normal user (ie. neither one was root)
  * Closing misc fixed bugs. closes #32809, #32274 (have been fixed,
    just need closing)
  * Tested lockvc with pam support, works for normal users (pam_pwdb)
    closes: #31150
  * Changed /var/log/wtmp in pam_lastlog docs to reflect correct
    /var/log/lastlog file. closes: #26544
  * Added -ldl to libpam.so, so apps don't have to

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Feb 1999 18:47:30 -0500

pam (0.66-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed pwdb_chkpwd to sgid shadow instead of suid root since it only
    needs read permissions to /etc/shadow and not write.
  * Moved a lot of files arouns to get rid of libpam-runtime dependencies
  * Put libpam-pwdb into it's own package
  * Removed -lpwdb links for modules since libpwdb is somewhat buggy (or
    alteast it's interaction with libpam is)
  * Fixed bug in pam_unix_passwd.so that caused it to never authenticate
    the correct passwd, making it so you couldn't change the passwd

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Feb 1999 15:50:28 -0500

pam (0.66-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed defaults in /etc/pam.d/other to be pam_unix_*.so modules instead
    of the accidental pam_pwdb.so module
  * Fixed suid of pwdb_chkpwd (had to move dh_fixperms after
    dh_suidregister)
  * Added Replaces: libpam0g-util in order to help dpkg upgrade from
    older packages
  * Applied glibc 2.1 patch from Christian Meder. closes: #32809
  * Moved libpam-doc to Section doc. closes: #32274

pam (0.66-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all of the versioned module stuff. Modules are now in
    /lib/security and stay there. Seems after discussion, that modules may
    not change as often as thought
  * Fixed suidregister for pwdb_chkpwd
  * Fixed incomplete descriptions in control file

pam (0.66-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * New upstream release. closes: #16882, #30862, #7725
  * Created a better split of the main lib and the runtime to kill the
    circular dependencies and make it possible to have two .so version of
    the library installed for upgrades. closes: #10234, #10406, #12210,
    bug #14291, #15528, #15529, #20660, #25330, #29868, #31088, #31128,
    bug #9131, #9919.
  * Harcoded modules directory prefixed with the .so version, and
    used alternatives to create the symlink to the 'default' modules
    directory. libpam will use the full path when specified, but use the
    versioned modules directory for relative names.
  * Put libpam0g-cracklib modules back in (own package). This means that
    cracklib support is _not_ in the static libpam.a, also cracklib
    support is _not_ in pam_unix_passwd.o, but only in pam_cracklib.so
    by itself.
  * Fixed a few typos in the source causing compile errors
  * Fixed source #include's so that pam _didn't_ have to be installed
    in order to compile the source ( changed from <> to "" )
  * Removed empty directories from built packages
  * Opted not to build examples, only going to put *.c files in examples
    directory for libpam0g-dev
  * Moved *.sgml files for modules into their own directory (looks like
    that is what the original maintainer wanted to do, but it didn't go)
  * Moved doc build to arch-indep build in rules so that it doesn't get
    built when specifying -B with debuild/dpkg-buildpackage.
  * Moved `touch .quiet...' to build-stamp in order to have -B builds not
    ask about pam.conf
  * Split out non-standard modules to their own package, so as to make the
    base install smaller (planning for base inclusion here)
  * Created small manpage for pwdb_chkpwd. closes: #10941
  * The Copright file in /usr/doc/*/ was already named copright and not
    compressed. closes: #14533
  * Package is now lintian clean. closes #19383, #5132
  * There is a maintainer now and the patch for #25915 is still included
    so.... closes: #25915
  * Added check for editor backup files in /etc/pam.d (*~). closes: #28075
  * Applied patch for md5.h in pam_pwdb module. closes: #31548
  * Added support for dhelp in libpam-doc. closes: #31191

  * Fixed distribution of files over the various packages, which was
    severely messed up.
  * Added appropriate Replaces: to ensure upgrading from both the hamm
    version and previous slink versions.
  * Fixed debug libraries, PAM module loading.
  * Added examples.
  * Added a "pam-undocumented" manpage pointing to libpam-doc, and
    made links for functions without a manpage to that.

pam (0.65-0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * It looks like I misunderstood DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH: Linux-PAM does not
    currently seem to be easily configured to look for modules in more than
    one directory. With this version, it's configured to look only in
    /lib/security .

pam (0.65-0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Moving the PAM modules to /lib/security broke netatalk.
    Added a preinst script to detect /etc/pam.d files with explicit paths to
    PAM modules, give a warning about them, and offer to abort the install
    (Fixes #27514).

pam (0.65-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Major package overhaul; now uses debhelper.
  * In experimental for now. *Please* provide feedback; if the feedback is
    positive, we can put this in slink.
  * Dropped libc5 support.
  * [libpam/pam_static.c] Fixed compilation: "pamh" was undefined; use "NULL".
    is this the correct fix?
  * [defs/debian.defs] New.
  * [Makefile]
    * Exit when a make in a subdirectory fails.
    * Compile statically too.
    * New variables: LC, LP, LPLIBS, DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH .
  * [libpam/Makefile]
    * Use DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH if nonempty.
    * Link libpam against LPLIBS.
  * [modules/*/Makefile]
    * Link the dynamic security objects against libpam and libc
     (LP and LC).
  * [modules/pam_pwdb/Makefile]
    * Link dynamic security objects against libcrypt and libnsl.
  * [conf/install_conf] Allow for non-interactive install (as the other
    install_conf scripts already did).
  * Automatically determine the list of /etc/security/* conffiles.
  * Moved libpam to /lib, and PAM modules to /lib/security as they will
    become part of the base system in the future.
  * Built without cracklib support, to keep the base system smaller.
  * /sbin/pwdb_chkpwd is undocumented, as is upperLOWER.

  * debian/rules: each package now has it's own doc directory under
    /usr/doc/, containing at least the copyright file (Policy 5.6).
  * debian/rules: install files with `install -m 644' not `cp -p' to avoid

  * libpam-dev becomes libpam0-altdev, libpam-util -> libpam0-altutil and

  * libpam0 depends on libpam0g because libpam0g contains the pam conffile.
  * libpam0-util depends on libpam0g-util because libpam0g contains the binary.
