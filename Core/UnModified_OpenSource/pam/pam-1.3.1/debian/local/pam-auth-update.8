.TH "PAM\-AUTH\-UPDATE" "8" "08/23/2008" "Debian"
.SH NAME
pam\-auth\-update - manage PAM configuration using packaged profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam\-auth\-update
.RB [ \-\-package " [" \-\-remove
.IR profile " [" profile\fR... "]]]"
.RB [ \-\-force ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pam\-auth\-update
is a utility that permits configuring the central authentication policy
for the system using pre-defined profiles as supplied by PAM module
packages.
Profiles shipped in the 
.I /usr/share/pam\-configs/
directory specify the modules, with options, to enable; the preferred
ordering with respect to other profiles; and whether a profile should be
enabled by default.
Packages providing PAM modules register their profiles at install time
by calling
.BR "pam\-auth\-update \-\-package" .
Selection of profiles is done using the standard debconf interface.
The profile selection question will be asked at `medium' priority when
packages are added or removed, so no user interaction is required by
default.
Users may invoke
.B pam\-auth\-update
directly to change their authentication configuration.
.PP
The script makes every effort to respect local changes to
.IR "/etc/pam.d/common-*".
Local modifications to the list of module options will be preserved, and
additions of modules within the managed portion of the stack will cause
.B pam\-auth\-update
to treat the config files as locally modified and not make further
changes to the config files unless given the
.B \-\-force
option.
.PP
If the user specifies that
.B pam\-auth\-update
should override local configuration changes, the locally-modified files
will be saved in
.I /etc/pam.d/
with a suffix of
.IR "\.pam\-old" .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-package
Indicate that the caller is a package maintainer script; lowers the
priority of debconf questions to `medium' so that the user is not
prompted by default.
.TP
.B \-\-enable \fIprofile \fR[\fIprofile\fR...]
Enable the specified profiles in system configuration. This is used to
enable profiles that are not on by default.
.TP
.B \-\-remove \fIprofile \fR[\fIprofile\fR...]
Remove the specified profiles from the system configuration.
.B pam\-auth\-update \-\-remove
should be used to remove profiles from the configuration before the
modules they reference are removed from disk, to ensure that PAM is in a
consistent and usable state at all times during package upgrades or
removals.
.TP
.B \-\-force
Overwrite the current PAM configuration, without prompting.
This option
.B must not
be used by package maintainer scripts; it is intended for use by
administrators only.
