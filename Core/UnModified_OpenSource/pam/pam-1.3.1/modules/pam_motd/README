pam_motd — Display the motd file

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_motd is a PAM module that can be used to display arbitrary motd (message of
the day) files after a successful login. By default the /etc/motd file is
shown. The message size is limited to 64KB.

OPTIONS

motd=/path/filename

    The /path/filename file is displayed as message of the day.

motd_dir=/path/dirname.d

    The /path/dirname.d directory is scanned and each file contained inside of
    it is displayed.

When no options are given, the default is to display both /etc/motd and the
contents of /etc/motd.d. Specifying either option (or both) will disable this
default behavior.

EXAMPLES

The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:

session  optional  pam_motd.so


To use a motd file from a different location:

session  optional  pam_motd.so motd=/elsewhere/motd


To use a motd file from elsewhere, along with a corresponding .d directory:

session  optional  pam_motd.so motd=/elsewhere/motd motd_dir=/elsewhere/motd.d
