Some ideas what to check and what the desired results would be:

- running dpkg-reconfigure with an already configured slapd

  Should either backup the database or ask before killing it. 
  Same for slapd.conf. Neither old configuration or old database 
  should be lost without the user confirming that this is what he wants.
