This directory contains stripped versions of schema files that the
OpenLDAP distribution includes in servers/slapd/schema.  The original
versions as distributed upstream contain text from the RFCs embedded as
comments, and that text is covered by the Internet Society license which
does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  (It doesn't permit
creation and distribution of modified versions.)  Accordingly, Debian
cannot include the original versions of these files in Debian packages.

Instead, in this directory are equivalent versions of those files with all
of the text taken from IETF RFCs or Internet-Drafts removed and only the
functional schema definition retained.

Where possible, the schema files as distributed by the OpenLDAP project
are retained.  This is only done where RFC or Internet-Draft text is
embedded in the schema file and covered by the Internet Society license.
