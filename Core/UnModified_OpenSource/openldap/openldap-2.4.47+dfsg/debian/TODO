openldap2.2 (2.2.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/slapd.NEWS: Summarize the upstream changes and make clear that
    the upgrade may be problemated. Sketch the upgrade procedure.
  * debian/README.Debian: Explain what to check for if upgrading fails and
    how to recover.
  * CARLO: debian/slapd.scripts-common: Handle all UTF-8 supported characters
    in organization field by converting the locale specific input into
    utf-8 and base64 encoding the result (closes: #236097).
  * Maintainer scripts: Handle the configuration to enable ldif dumping
    correctly: Dump if requested and only slapadd the data if it is 
    supposed to be there.
  * Check ITS#3267 (possible data loss) and apply the patch to the 
    package.
  * CARLO: Escape special chars in the names of backup LDIF files using
    the %xx syntax.
  * Check lintian warning: Postinst uses db_input. I think the usage is
    okay as it is an error message IIRC which is also output using cat
    in case debconf is not available.

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refactoring of the maintainer scripts. Goals:
    + No more direct access to global variables but accessor functions
      to check for invalid uses. Example: Don't use $OLD_VERSION but 
      `get_previous_version`. That way invalid uses can easily be flagged
      if that information is not available anymore.
  * Remove perl script to hash a password and use slappasswd instead.
