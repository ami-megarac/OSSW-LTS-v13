.SH NAME
pkcs1\-conv \- convert keys from PKCS#1 format to s-expression format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkcs1-conv
.RB [{ \-\-private-rsa-key | \-\-public-rsa-key | \-\-public-key-info }
.RB [ \-\-base-64 ]]
.RI <\  FILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B pkcs1\-conv
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBpkcs1\-conv\fP converts private and public RSA keys from PKCS #1 
format to sexp format.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`\-').
.PP
By default pkcs1-conv expects a PEM-encapsulated RSA key on standard input,
and will determine its type from the Pre-Encapsulation Boundary.
To convert a DER-encoded (non PEM-encoded) key, one of the first three
options below must be used:
.TP
.B \-\-private-rsa-key
Specify that a DER-encoded RSAPrivateKey, as defined by PKCS #1 (RFC 3447),
and described in section A.1.2 of its appendix A, is to be expected as input.
.TP
.B \-\-public-rsa-key
Specify that a DER-encoded RSAPublicKey, as defined by PKCS #1 (RFC 3447),
and described in section A.1.1 of its appendix A, is to be expected as input.
.TP
.B \-\-public-key-info
Specify that a DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as defined by PKCS #6, 
and described in section A.1 of its appendix A, encapsulating an RSAPublicKey,
is to be expected as input.
.TP
.B \-\-base-64
Together with \-\-private-rsa-key, \-\-public-rsa-key, or \-\-public-key-info,
specify that base64 encoding is applied on top of the DER encoding.
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
Show summary of options (not implemented).
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
pkcs1\-conv will complain and exit with a status of 1
if the input doesn't match expectations. In PEM mode 
(when no option is used), if no PEM block is found, pkcs1\-conv
will output nothing but exit with a zero status.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
$ openssl genrsa \-out privkey.pem
$ pkcs1\-conv < privkey.pem > privkey.sexp
$ openssl rsa \-in privkey.pem \-outform DER \-out privkey.der
$ openssl rsa \-in privkey.pem \-outform DER \-pubout \-out pubkey.der
$ pkcs1-conv \-\-rsa-private-key < privkey.der > privkey.sexp
$ pkcs1-conv \-\-public-key-info < pubkey.der > pubkey.sexp
.fi
