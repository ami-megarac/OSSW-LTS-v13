nettle (3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #884013).

nettle (2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

    sorting things out.
    - Drop rsa2sexp_algorithm_name.dpatch, 20_link_with_gmp.dpatch;
      incorporated upstream.
    - The SOVERSIONs of libnettle and libhogweed have changed to 4 and 2,
      respectively; update and rename debian/control, debian/libnettle3.*,

  * Build-depend on the new libgmp10-dev instead of libgmp3-dev.

    be smart and pick /usr/lib32 or /usr/lib64 on certain platforms.

nettle (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * rsa2sexp_algorithm_name.dpatch (new): Use a default algorithm name

  * debian/control: Add ${misc:Depends} to all packages lacking it.
  * debian/control: nettle-dev: Depend on dpkg (>= 1.15.4) | install-info
    as recommended for the transition to triggerized install-info.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.8.3 with the previous change.

nettle (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - There was no lsh-utils 2.0.3-2 in Debian, so the conflict is with
      lsh-utils < 2.0.4-dfsg-1.
    - Drop the transitional libnettle-dev package that was in experimental. 
      Due to the split, depending packages will need sourceful uploads anyway.

    libhogweed1.
    - Drop 10_cleanup.dpatch; incorporated upstream.
    - Rename libnettle-dev as nettle-dev.

    (<< 2.0.3-2, which is anticipated to stop shipping an identical
    sexp-conv and depend on nettle-bin instead).
  * Link with --as-needed to avoid unnecessary NEEDED tags.

nettle (1.15-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer install sexp-conv as an alternative; conflict with lsh-utils
    prior to 2.0.4-dfsg-1, which depends on nettle-bin instead of shipping
    a copy of sexp-conv (Closes: #510942). Drop nettle-bin.postinst and
    nettle-bin.prerm (nettle-bin.prerm will remove the alternative on
    upgrade, which is actually a bug, but works out fine in this case).
  * Switch to Debhelper level 5. Remove files that don't exist from install
    lists (copied from a template, apparently).
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.8.1:
    + Add debian/README.source (§ 4.9).

    machine-readable information may not be completely accurate at this
    point due to the many different authors and licenses.
  * Don't ignore make potential distclean errors.
  * debian/libnettle-dev.doc-base: Change section to Programming/C
    following the abolishion of the Apps section.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 without any changes.
