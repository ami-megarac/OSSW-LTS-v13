Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic 
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:
 .
    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudo-random stream, using the Knuth 
      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudo-random generator.
    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp
      syntax.
    - pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.
    - nettle-hash - command-line tool to compute message digests such as SHA-1.
