Debian release of PCRE 4.5 had

PCRE_LIB_VERSION=13:0:10
PCRE_POSIXLIB_VERSION=13:0:10

which corresponds to latest debian-revision (soname libpcre.so.3,
installed as libpcre.so.3.9.0) and followed the instructions about version
numbering in the libtool manual:
|  3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
|     update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').

13:1:10

  4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
     last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.

14:0:10

  5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
     then increment AGE.

14:0:11

  6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
     then set AGE to 0.

n/a

Therefore I'm using 14:0:11 for this release of PCRE 5.0
