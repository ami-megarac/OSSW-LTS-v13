 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 26 May 2005 05:15:34 +0000

    - compatible, so same soname and package name can be used.
  * Compile with --enable-unicode-properties, a new feature of PCRE 5.0
  * Removed . from description in control file
  * Included patch from Niibe Yutaka for cross building (Closes: #285407)
  
  Thanks Andreas for the NMU, which this is based on (Closes: #237644, #237265)

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Wed, 16 Feb 2005 21:47:14 +0000

pcre3 (4.5-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU to fix rc-bugs.
  * Update libtool related files to fix build-error on mips, keep original
    config.in, as it is no generated file. (Closes: #237265)
  * pcregrep replaces pgrep. (Closes: #237564)
  * Bump shlibs, pcre 4.5 includes two new functions.
  * Let pgrep's /usr/share/doc symlink point to the package it depends on,

 -- Andreas Metzler <ametzler@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Mar 2004 13:23:02 +0100

pcre3 (4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  Thanks to Andreas Metzler for patches for all the following:
  
  * doc/pcregrep.1: added newline between synopsis for pcregrep and that
    for zpcregrp (Closes: #197899)
  * debian/control: Change package descriptions (Closes: #209904)
  * debian/rules and others: Renamed pgrep package to pcregrep, to match
    name of binary and avoid confusion with pgrep (which greps for
    processes, and is in the procps package; a dummy pgrep package will
    ease upgrades (Closes: #217076)

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Wed, 25 Feb 2004 20:49:33 +0000

pcre3 (4.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libpcre3.files: include pcrepattern(3) manpage in libpcre3
    package instead of libpcre3-dev package. This means that anyone using
    a PCRE based application will have the man page available.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Thu,  8 Jan 2004 21:19:51 +0000

pcre3 (4.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ltmain.sh: Replaced with standard version from debian libtool package,
    but with Phil Hazel's patch applied (although I suspect his patch
    isn't necessary on debian systems). (Closes: #198147, #198668) I hope.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Wed, 25 Jun 2003 21:09:22 +0100

pcre3 (4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * pcretest.c: Cheat at test! Always print 40 instead of the size,
    because the size varies on different architectures, and we don't
    really want to fail the test because of this.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Thu, 19 Jun 2003 21:00:39 +0100

pcre3 (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release is entirely the work of Andreas Metzler <ametzler@debian.org>.
  Thanks Andreas.  

  * new upstream version (Closes: 182570)
  * this version apparently fixes infinite loop bug (Closes: 161184)
  * repacked using debhelper and upstream's Makefile. Switch to libtool's
    versioning scheme, see debian/README.Versioning.libtool for details.
    (Closes: #187371)
  * (however, don't ship .la files, they only give libtool strange ideas, see
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/debian-devel-200304/msg00827.html
    for an example.)
  * changed compile-options to really follow policy 3.5.7
  * debian/control: changed description to say "Perl 5" as Perl 6, when it
    eventually appears, will have yet another different regex syntax
    (Closes: #166939) 

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Mon, 16 Jun 2003 22:11:08 +0100

pcre3 (3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #119429, #161424)
  * Added zpcregrep script by Samuel Tardieu (Closes: #36897)
  * doc/pcregrep.1: mention zpcregrep
  * debian/rules: use && in test rule rather than -a option to test, for
    better POSIX compatibility (Closes: #158775)
  * debian/Makefile: build pcretest once with -rpath for doing tests, and
    once without, so that:
  * debian/rules: install pcretest program (Closes: #162998)
  * Don't create or remove /usr/doc/foo symlinks. This means that none of
    the packages have prerms and only libpcre3 has a postinst
  * debian/copyright: corrected to "Debian GNU/Linux"
  * debian/control: standards version updated to 3.5.7.0
  * debian/rules: strip comment and note sections from libraries
  * The result of the last four changes is that it should now be
    lintian-clean apart from one caused by a known bug in lintian (see
    lintian bug #117260) (Closes: #162999)

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 18:12:13 +0100

pcre3 (3.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Rebuild with a version of libc6 without a broken atexit() symbol
    (closes: #108597, critical).
  * Add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH rather than clobbering it, to avoid fakeroot
    dying (closes: #108661, #108891).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Aug 2001 20:43:28 +0100

pcre3 (3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version (Closes: #93876)

pcre3 (3.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: install pcregrep as that name (only) rather than as
    pgrep with a symlink called pcregrep. This avoids a name clash with
    the process table grepper also called pgrep.
  * doc/pcregrep.1: change name of program being documented (back) to
    pcregrep.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Tue, 23 Jan 2001 23:54:08 +0000

pcre3 (3.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: only install config files that are meant to be installed
    in libpcre3-dev package (Closes: #78354)
  * debian/Makefile: distclean target clears up configure output

pcre3 (3.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: make debian/Makefile executable before trying to run it
    (Closes: #74316)

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 21:18:15 +0100

pcre3 (3.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: pgrep should symlink to docs in /usr/doc/libpcre3, not
    /usr/doc/libpcre2
  * debian/rules: manpage pgrep.1.gz should not be installed as executable!
  * debian/rules: pcregrep.1.gz is symlink to pgrep.1.gz
  * doc/pcre-config.1: basic manpage for pcre-config written
  * debian/rules: install pcre-config.1
  * debian/rules: use -isp option to dpkg-gencontrol

  What follows is the changelog from pcre2, up to the point where the pcre3
  package was made.

  * new upstream version (#50386)
  * put -lc after -lpcre when linking libpcreposix (#50046)

pcre2 (2.07-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: use /usr/share/doc and /usr/share/man, as mandated by
    policy 3.1.0
  * debian/postinst: create /usr/doc symlink; don't install library
  * debian/postinst-lib (new file): create /usr/doc symlink and install library

    postinst-lib for library package

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 1999 18:57:59 +0000

pcre2 (2.07-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * pcre.c, pcre.h: new upstream version is incompatible with old one! I've 
    done a nasty hack so that old binaries will still work. Old source won't, 
    but at least it won't fail silently so this shouldn't be a major problem.
  * debian/rules: /usr/doc/pgrep should be a link to libpcre2, not libpcre1
    (#42450)

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Tue,  3 Aug 1999 23:58:35 +0100

pcre2 (2.02-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: install copyright in correct location in libpcre2-dev; 
    a typo before meant the package wouldn't install
  * debian/shlibs: update to refer to libpcre2 instead of libpcre1

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Fri, 29 Jan 1999 00:12:00 +0000

pcre2 (2.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * first release of pcre2
  * install source of pgrep (it's small) in /usr/doc/libpcre2-dev/examples

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Thu, 28 Jan 1999 00:45:00 +0000

pcre (1.09-2) unstable; urgency=low

  What follows is the changelog from pcre 1, up to the point where the pcre2
  package was made.

  The changes are not that large but the API, and therefore the ABI, are
  changed so version 2 is not compatible.

  * pcreposix.c,pcreposix.h: prefixed function names with pcreposix_
  * pcreposix.h: #defines so un-prefixed names can be used
  * These mean pcre routines will be used instead of the regex library
    built into libc (#22525)
  * debian/shlibs: pcreposix needs libpcre1 >=1.09-2 now
  * debian/rules: it's not pcre 1.01 any more.

  * Nasty trick so pgrep gets the right dependencies whether or not
    libpcre1 is installed
  
 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Tue,  2 Dec 1997 17:57:07 +0000

pcre (1.01-3) unstable; urgency=low
