# Runs all tests with the extention "multi" for several times.
# Each testprogram <programname>.multi has an own subdirectory
# <programmname> in which several testcases are defined for this program

#
#             <programname>.in
#             <programname>.out
#             <programname>.err

# "<programname>.in". The standard output will be compared with the
# files "<programname>.out" and "<programname>.err".
# The testcase is successful if the program returns 0 AND the outputs
# are identically equal to the files "<programname>.out" and
# "<programname>.err".
