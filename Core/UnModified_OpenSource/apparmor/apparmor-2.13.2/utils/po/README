GENERATING TRANSLATION MESSAGES

To generate the messages.pot file:

Run the following command in Translate.
python pygettext.py ../apparmor/*.py ../Tools/aa*

It will generate the messages.pot file in the Translate directory.

You might need to provide the full path to pygettext.py from your python installation. It will typically be in the /path/to/python/libs/Tools/i18n/pygettext.py
