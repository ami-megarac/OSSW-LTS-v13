Subject: Make tunables/share play well with aliases.

This reverts commit aa3022208f539978f137c918ede01c80cacd8567.

Space-separated list of values don't play well with aliases.
For example, in Tails, despite this alias rule:

  alias / -> /lib/live/mount/rootfs/*.squashfs/,

â€¦ the Tor Browser profile denies access to
/lib/live/mount/rootfs/filesystem.squashfs/usr/share/mime/mime.cache, which
should be equivalent to /usr/share/mime/mime.cache. That's fixed by using
alternations instead; too bad they're less readable.

Cherry-picked from master branch: a91d199ab1da3004cf3744d7087a32c91097a16e.
