The multi-run testsuite works as follows:

In the base netdomain testsuite directory, there are two binaries: 
test_multi.send and test_multi.receive.

The testcases are in test_multi/[testcase_name].testcase.  These testcases 
contain key/value pairs separated by a colon:
	- send_ip: [ip address the sending program should bind to]
	- send_port: [port number the sending program should bind to]
	- send_profile: [the netdomain profile string for the sending program.
	  It can be blank]
	- receive_ip: [ip address the receive program should bind to]
	- receive_port: [port number the receive program should bind to]
	- receive_profile: [the netdomain profile string for the receive 
	  program.  It can be blank]
	- proto: [udp or tcp]
	- message: [A message string that the sending program will send to the
	  receiving program]

In test_multi/output there are the expected output files:
	- [testcase_name].send.out
	- [testcase_name].receive.out

When the test suite runs, it will execute the sending and receiving 
programs in parallel with the appropriate testcase settings applied to 
them.  Once the programs have finished executing, the output is diff'd 
against the expected output to determine whether or not the test passes.
