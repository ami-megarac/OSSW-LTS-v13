Description: server, proxy and client implementing HTTP/2
 This package will install a set of programs implementing the HTTP/2
 protocol: a standalone server (nghttp2-server), a reverse proxy
 (nghttp2-proxy) and a client (nghttp2-client). It provides no files
 on its own and is not necessary for these programs to work.
