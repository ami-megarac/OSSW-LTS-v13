nghttp2 (1.3.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release introduces a split into 3 subpackages: nghttp2-client,
  nghttp2-server and nghttp2-proxy. The nghttp2 package depends on all
  of them, but provides no files on its own. You can customize your
  nghttp2 installation by removing nghttp2-* packages that you don't
  use and/or removing the generic nghttp2 package.
