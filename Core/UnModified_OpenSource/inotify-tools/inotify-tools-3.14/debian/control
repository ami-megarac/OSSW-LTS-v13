Description: utility wrapper around inotify
 Inotify is a Linux kernel feature enabling user space programs to
 monitor parts of the filesystem in a efficient way. libinotifytools
 is a thin layer on top of the kernel interface which makes it easy
 to set up watches on many files at once, read events without having
 to deal with low-level I/O, and several utility functions for inotify-
 related string formatting

Description: command-line programs providing a simple interface to inotify
 inotify-tools is a set of command-line programs for Linux providing a
 simple interface to inotify. These programs can be used to monitor and
 act upon filesystem events. inotify-tools consists of two utilities:
 .
 inotifywait simply blocks for inotify events, making it appropriate
 for use in shell scripts.
 .
 inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts
 of each inotify event.
