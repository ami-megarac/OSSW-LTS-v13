Debian modifications to .orig.tar.gz
====================================

The upstream tarball was stripped of the doc/ subdirectory because the
RFCs contained therein are indistributable under the terms of the DFSG.
Additionally, any MIB contained in an RFC has been removed.
No other files were changed.

Use the command
debian/rules get-orig-source
to perform these steps.
