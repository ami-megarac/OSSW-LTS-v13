net-snmp (5.7.3+dfsg-6+deb10u1) buster-security; urgency=medium

 NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB is now read-only. This means you can only
 add new items through the configuration file and not using 
 SNMP SET commands.

net-snmp (5.4.3~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 5.4.3, upstream ships a new default configuration in
  /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, which only uses SNMPv3 rather than SNMPv1 and
  SNMPv2c. This new default configuration also binds to udp:127.0.0.1:161
  by default which conflicts with the former specification of 127.0.0.1
  in /etc/default/snmpd, so now snmpd must be reconfigured here in order
  to be exposed to the network. Be sure to check both files after an
  upgrade.

net-snmp (5.4.2.1~dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 5.4.2.1~dfsg-4, this package no longer downloads the MIBs
  from IETF or IANA, but suggests the package snmp-mibs-downloader in
  contrib to do this job. Please consider installing this package if you
  need the SNMP MIBs.

net-snmp (5.4.2.1~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 5.4.2.1, the MIBs from IETF (the ones distributed as
  RFC) and from IANA are no longer distributed with this package due to
  license reasons.

  By default, snmpd is now started without any MIBs loaded, so you can't
  use symbolic names in the configuration anymore. Neither are the snmp
  clients able to resolved numeric OIDs to symbolic names. This default
  can be changed by editing the /etc/defaults/snmpd file and comment out
  the MIB environment variable.

  In order to download the MIBs, you can either do this during package
  installation or later using the commands

  cd /usr/share/mibs
  make -f Makefile.mib

  Note you need to be able to connect to
  ftp://ftp.ietf.org for downloading the RFCs and
  http://www.iana.org for downloading the IANA definitions.

net-snmp (5.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 5.2.2, the default configuration disables SMUX support
  and binds the SNMP port to 127.0.0.1.
  
  Please configure /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny
  first to set up who can access the SNMP daemon, then edit
  /etc/default/snmpd and remove 127.0.0.1 from SNMPDOPTS.

  To enable SMUX again, remove "-I -smux" from SNMPDOPTS and eventually
  bind it to localhost by adding "smuxsocket 127.0.0.1" to
  /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.
