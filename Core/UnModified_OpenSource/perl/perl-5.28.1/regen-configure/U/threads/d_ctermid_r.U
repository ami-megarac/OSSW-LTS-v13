?S:d_ctermid_r:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines the HAS_CTERMID_R symbol,
?S:	which indicates to the C program that the ctermid_r()
?S:	routine is available.
?S:.
?S:ctermid_r_proto:
?S:	This variable encodes the prototype of ctermid_r.
?S:	It is zero if d_ctermid_r is undef, and one of the
?S:	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_ctermid_r
?S:	is defined.
?S:.
?C:HAS_CTERMID_R:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the ctermid_r routine
?C:	is available to ctermid re-entrantly.
?C:.
?C:CTERMID_R_PROTO:
?C:	This symbol encodes the prototype of ctermid_r.
?C:	It is zero if d_ctermid_r is undef, and one of the
?C:	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_ctermid_r
