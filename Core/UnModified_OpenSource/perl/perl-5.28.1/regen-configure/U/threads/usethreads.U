Perl can be built to offer a form of threading support on some systems
To do so, Configure can be run with -Dusethreads.

Note that Perl built with threading support runs slightly slower
and uses slightly more memory than plain Perl.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default '$dflt'.

You cannot have both the ithreads and the 5.005 threads enabled
at the same time.  Disabling the 5.005 threads since they are
much less stable than the ithreads.
