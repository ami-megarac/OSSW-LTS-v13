These units are intended to eventually live up to the INSTALL-1.58
specifications.  Right now, they are woefully incomplete, but I am
about to fall off the end of the e-world for quite a while, so I'm
sending you what I have now in the hopes that someone will be able to
pick up on it and complete it.  I think this is the best I'll be able to
do prior to the perl conference.

If the squirrel hadn't climbed into the campus power transformer and
taken us down for most of Monday and Tuesday, and if I hadn't spent 10
hours yesterday at the car repair shop (and another 4 hours on the road)
I might have gotten further.  Sorry about that :-(.

I'll be unsubscribing from p5p, so if you have questions, please
contact me directly.  I will still check my mail about once
a week, but probably not more often for a while.

The vendor* stuff is only vaguely sketched out.  Since it all
defaults to being unused, you may delete it if
implementing it is taking too long.

I've tried to mark with XXX some known problem spots, but I know
I've missed many.

Good luck and have the appropriate amount of fun :-).
