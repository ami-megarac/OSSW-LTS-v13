?S:privlib:
?S:	This variable contains the eventual value of the PRIVLIB symbol,
?S:	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
?S:	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
?S:	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).

?D:privlibexp=''
?S:privlibexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of privlib, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

?D:installprivlib=''
?S:installprivlib:
?S:	This variable is really the same as privlibexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.
?S:.
?C:PRIVLIB:
?C:	This symbol contains the name of the private library for this package.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.  The program
?C:	should be prepared to do ~ expansion.
?C:.
?C:PRIVLIB_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of PRIVLIB, to be used
?C:	in programs that are not prepared to deal with ~ expansion at run-time.

There are some auxiliary files for $package that need to be put into a
private library directory that is accessible by everyone.
