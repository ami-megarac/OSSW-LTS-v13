?D:sitelib=''
?S:sitelib:
?S:	This variable contains the eventual value of the SITELIB symbol,
?S:	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
?S:	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
?S:	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).
?S:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?S:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?S:	architecture-independent modules in this directory with
?S:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?S:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.
?S:.
?D:sitelibexp=''
?S:sitelibexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of sitelib, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.
?S:.
?D:installsitelib=''
?S:installsitelib:
?S:	This variable is really the same as sitelibexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.
?S:.
?S:sitelib_stem:
?S:	This variable is $sitelibexp with any trailing version-specific component
?S:	removed.  The elements in inc_version_list (inc_version_list.U) can
?S:	be tacked onto this variable to generate a list of directories to search.
?S:.
?C:SITELIB:
?C:	This symbol contains the name of the private library for this package.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.  The program
?C:	should be prepared to do ~ expansion.
?C:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?C:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?C:	architecture-independent modules in this directory with
?C:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?C:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.
?C:.
?C:SITELIB_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of SITELIB, to be used
?C:	in programs that are not prepared to deal with ~ expansion at run-time.
?C:.
?C:SITELIB_STEM:
?C:	This define is SITELIB_EXP with any trailing version-specific component
?C:	removed.  The elements in inc_version_list (inc_version_list.U) can
?C:	be tacked onto this variable to generate a list of directories to search.

The installation process will create a directory for
site-specific extensions and modules.  Most users find it convenient
to place all site-specific files in this directory rather than in the
main distribution directory.
