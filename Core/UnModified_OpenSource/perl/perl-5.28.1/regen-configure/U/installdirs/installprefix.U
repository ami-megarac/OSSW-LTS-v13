Since you are running AFS, I need to distinguish the directory in which
files will reside from the directory in which they are installed (and from
which they are presumably copied to the former directory by occult means).

EOM
	case "$installprefix" in
	'') dflt=`echo $prefix | sed 's#^/afs/#/afs/.#'`;;
	*) dflt="$installprefix";;
	esac
else
$cat <<EOM

In some special cases, particularly when building $package for distribution,
it is convenient to distinguish the directory in which files should be
installed from the directory ($prefix) in which they will
eventually reside.  For most users, these two directories are the same.

EOM
	case "$installprefix" in
	'') dflt=$prefix ;;
	*) dflt=$installprefix;;
	esac
