?S:vendorarch:
?S:	This variable contains the value of the PERL_VENDORARCH symbol.
?S:	It may have a ~ on the front.
?S:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?S:	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
?S:	architecture-dependent modules and extensions in this directory with
?S:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
?S:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.
?S:.
?S:vendorarchexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorarch, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.
?S:.
?D:installvendorarch=''
?S:installvendorarch:
?S:	This variable is really the same as vendorarchexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.
?S:.
?S:d_vendorarch:
?S:	This variable conditionally defined PERL_VENDORARCH.
?S:.
?C:PERL_VENDORARCH:
?C:	If defined, this symbol contains the name of a private library.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.
?C:	It may have a ~ on the front.
?C:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?C:	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
?C:	architecture-dependent modules and extensions in this directory with
?C:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
?C:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.
?C:.
?C:PERL_VENDORARCH_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of PERL_VENDORARCH, to be used
?C:	in programs that are not prepared to deal with ~ expansion at run-time.
