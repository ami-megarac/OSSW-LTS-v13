$cat <<EOM

After $package is installed, you may wish to install various
add-on modules and utilities.  Typically, these add-ons will
be installed under $prefix with the rest
of this package.  However, you may wish to install such add-ons
elsewhere under a different prefix.

If you do not wish to put everything under a single prefix, that's
ok.  You will be prompted for the individual locations; this siteprefix
is only used to suggest the defaults.

The default should be fine for most people.
