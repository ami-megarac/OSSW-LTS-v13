?MAKE:installstyle: prefix Myread
?MAKE:	-pick add $@ %<
?X:	Myread dependence is for dflt.
?S:installstyle:
?S:	This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.
?S:	This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
?S:	manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
?S:	this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
?S:	stored directly in Config.pm.  Currently, there are only two
?S:	styles:  "lib" and "lib/perl5".  The default library locations
?S:	(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $prefix/lib or
?S:	$prefix/lib/perl5.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
?S:	directory dedicated to perl (e.g. /opt/perl), while the latter
?S:	is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
?S:	$prefix=/usr/local.
?S:
?S:	Unfortunately, while this "style" variable is used to set
?S:	defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
?S:	site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
?S:	appropriate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix
?S:	might be /opt/perl, but $siteprefix might be /usr/local.
?S:	(Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been
?S:	supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)
?S:
?S:	The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
?S:	that can be used to install additional modules into
?S:	non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
?S:	a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting PREFIX on
?S:	the Makefile.PL command line), then there is no reason to
?S:	assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be
?S:	relevant for that PREFIX.
?S:
?S:	This may later be extended to include other information, so
?S:	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.
?S:
?S:	For compatibility with perl5.005 and earlier, the default
?S:	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
?S:	"perl".
?S:.

: For now, try to deduce it from prefix unless it is already set.
