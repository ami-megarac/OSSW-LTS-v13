?X: If the user has the cppstdin wrapper, perl.c will try to call
?X: CPPSTDIN, but that will point to a location in the build
?X: directory, not the installed version!.  Here, we'll just strip the
?X: name down to 'cppstdin', and rely on the fact that perl.c will
?X: then call SCRIPTDIR/cppstdin, but local things like 'make depend'
?X: will continue to work.
: Remove build directory name from cppstdin so it can be used from
