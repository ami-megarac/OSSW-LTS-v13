Cross building packages that link against libperl

Since version 5.22.1-7, libperl-dev no longer depends on perl of the
same architecture.  This should make it possible to cross build packages
build depending on libperl-dev, by replacing ExtUtils::Embed calls like

 perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts
 perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts

with something like

 perl -I /usr/lib/$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)/perl/cross-config-$(perl -MConfig -e 'print $Config{version}') -MExtUtils::Embed [...]

so that Config.pm for the host (target) architecture gets loaded and
provides the right header and linker paths.

This support is currently very much experimental. Success or failure
reports are welcome at <perl@packages.debian.org>.

See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813384#10 for more
information.
