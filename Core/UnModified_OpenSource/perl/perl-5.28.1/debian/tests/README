This directory holds rudimentary autopkgtest regression checks for
src:perl. We mostly test backwards compatibility with things like reading
in old binary files (zlib, Berkeley DB etc.) and making sure we can still
retrieve their contents.

We also run an existing maintainer test for checking the status of 
separately packaged dual life modules in the archive. This is expected
to regress when somebody e.g. packages a new dual life module, and
the fix is to add corresponding Breaks/Provides/Replaces or special
case it in the test.

This is work in progress, and suggestions for further tests are very
welcome.
