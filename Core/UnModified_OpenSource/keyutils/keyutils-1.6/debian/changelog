       + Skip tests requiring root
         They don't work with some container solutions due to their close
         interaction with the kernel. These tests are moved to

         Clean out tests not requiring machine-isolation, as these are
         performed by the test upstream-runtime-tests.

    - Add Debian-specific-kernel-feature-tests.patch
      Fold various Debian kernel feature test patches into one, dropping all
      the other patches
    - Drop Disable-some-tests.patch
      The test is guarded by a kernel feature test for CONFIG_BIG_KEYS, which
      we disable in another patch anyway
  * d/tests: Split tests in two: isolation-machine required, or not
  * d/control: Add Rules-Requires-Root: no
    We don't need (fake)root to build the packages

    Bug #881830 blocking this has been fixed in stable in 2017, and the fix
    should have propagated to the buildds by now

keyutils (1.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    the upstream feature tests only checks for kernel version and not actually
    enabled kernel options.

keyutils (1.5.9-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add package-specific d/gbp.conf
  * d/patches:
    - Drop patch numbers from .patch filenames
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6 (no changes needed)
    - Mark package keyutils-dbg as Multi-Arch: same
    - Mark package keyutils-dev as Multi-Arch: same
    - Mark package keyutils as Multi-Arch: foreign
    - Drop XS-Testsuite. dpkg now recognizes the Testsuite header, and
      dpkg-source automatically adds one when an autopkgtest suite is found
    - Switch Maintainer email to my @debian.org address
  * d/copyright:
    - Fix a Files pattern (the GPL-2+ applies to all but two files)
    - Bump copyright years
  * d/patches (dropped):
    - Enable-skipping-of-MAXDESCLEN-tests
      This was a Debian-specific temporary workaround for a kernel issue on
      arm64, MIPS, and sparc.
        + The arm64 issue (#754206) is no longer reproducible on a porter box
          which also has a 3.16 (albeit a later release), so lets see if these
          just were early arm64 adoption problems
        + The patch added below addresses the problem on MIPS more cleanly
        + sparc has been dropped in the meantime
  * d/patches (updated):
     - Enable-skipping-test-requiring-installation.patch
     - enable-skipping-tests-req-root.patch
     - man-page-syntax-fixes.patch
       Added DEP3 Applied-Upstream headers to the above three
  * d/patches (added):
    - Disable-tests-hitting-bug-in-MIPS-kernel-3.19.patch
      This disables the "overlong description length" tests when running on a
      MIPS kernel earlier than 3.19. They could not pass because of a kernel
      bug. Closes: #779351
    - Add patch Make-testcase-aware-of-a-kernel-behaviour-change.patch
      This was a transient issue with kernels 3.8 - 3.12. Closes: #768905

keyutils (1.5.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - On mips, mipsel, and sparc, add a build flag disabling tests for maximum
      description length. These tests appear to be too strict. Fixes a FTBFS on
      this platforms. Closes: #749657
  * debian/patches (added):
    - 0016-Disable-maxdesclen-tests-on-mipsel-sparc
      On some platforms, the maximum description length seems to be longer than
      assumed by the tests (verified manually), so we add a build flag that
      allows us to disable those tests.

  * debian/patches (added):
    - Add patch 0014-Conditionalize-tests-based-on-kernel-version
      Check the kernel version before running some tests to make sure that the
      currently running kernel supports the features they require, thereby
      avoiding a FTBFS on buildds with older kernels. Closes: #749657
    - Add patch 0015-Insert-delay-in-key-invalidation-test

  * debian/patches (added):
    - 0013-Enable-skipping-test-requiring-installation
    Allow skipping of tests requiring an installation. The request2 and
    prequest2 require the /sbin/request-key helper, but the kernel looks for
    this in the real root (outside of any chroot).

    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed)
    - Add XS-Testsuite: autopkgtest
    - Add Vcs-* URLs
  * debian/rules:
    - dpkg-deb uses xz compression by default now, no need to request it
    - Explicitly set DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH
    - override_dh_auto_test: execute tests with a modified PATH and
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the build result is tested instead of the
      installed versions. Furthermore, skip tests requiring root.
  * debian/source/options:
    - Remove (xz compression is the default now)

    - 0009-Use-bash-to-execute-the-tests
      The test fixtures make heavy use of bashisms; removal should be
      discussed/coordinated with upstream first
    - 0010-enable-skipping-tests-req-root
      Allow skipping of tests that need root privileges (which we don't have at
      build time).
    - 0011-Disable-some-tests
      Some test do not properly check whether features they need are available.
      This will be fixed in the next upstream release.
    - 0012-Remove-RHEL-specific-feature-test
      The numeric test clashes with "unstable" as a release version.
