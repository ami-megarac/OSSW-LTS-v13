/*
 * The automatic initialization cannot be part of the main shared library,
 * because there is no thread-safe way to change the environ global
 * variable. This is not a problem if the initializaion happens just at
 * program load time, but becomes one if the shared library is directly or
 * indirectly dlopen()ed during the execution of the program, which could
 * have either kept references to the old environ or could change it in
 * some other thread. This has been observed for example on systems using
 * Samba NSS modules.
 *
 * To avoid any other possible fallout, the constructor is split into a
 * new static library that needs to be linked explicitly into programs
 * using setproctitle(). As an additional safety measure the pkg-config
 * linker flags will mark the program as not allowing to be dlopen()ed
 * so that we make sure to avoid the problem described above.
