    hurd: Return EIEIO on non-responding interrupted servers
    
    since we do not actually know whether the RPC was completed or not,
    which makes a huge difference for e.g. write(), so better really error
    out than letting caller think that the RPC did not happen.
    
            * hurd/intr-msg.c (_hurd_intr_rpc_mach_msg): When the server does not
            answer to interrupt_operation, return EIEIO instead of EINTR.
