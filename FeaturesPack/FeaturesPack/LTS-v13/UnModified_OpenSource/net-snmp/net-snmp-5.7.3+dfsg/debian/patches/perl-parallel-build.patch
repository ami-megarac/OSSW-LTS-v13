Subject: Makefile: compile perl after library

During a parallel build the perl module is made without linking
to the non-completed library which makes a useless perl module.

This minor change to the Makefile means the perl module is made
after the library is made.

Closes: #894626
Thanks to Gregor Herrmann for the patch.
