popt for Debian
---------------

Because of its non-free license, the postscript documentation for popt has
been removed.  man 3 popt will still give you pretty good information on how
to use popt in your programs.  Sorry about the inconvenience, but you can
always email Erik Troan about it if the manpage isn't useful to you.  =>
